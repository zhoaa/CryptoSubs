I threw a nice chunk into LTC at $32, while ETH was also down to $90-$100.. seeing ETH now hurtz
this regular dumping is **not clearly a problem...**

The LTC price stagnates, while the other coins go up ...  Clearly, the same hands are always buying. Very strong hands (and via grayscale and its regular and massive purchases, drying up the market, we know that these strong hands are very rich institutional investors)

This will only make the weak hands, having in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a small 50% of profit, quit the deal...

&#x200B;

This is the definition of a very **strong consolidation.**

Elon musk does an interesting job of advertising around the coins.  Doge remains and will remain a meme coin, and  inevitably new incoming solid investors will turn to historical solid coins.

We have been accepting cryptocurrency since 2018; that's when the original BTC/LTC sign was put up that you see there. We now are now also accepting ETH, XLM, BCH, and DASH! Currently out of the barbers working at this particular location, 4 barbers(myself included) are prepared to accept these currencies.

***We now also have a promotion going on where you get 10% off your services if you pay in cryptocurrency! We offer Haircuts, Beard trims, Hot towel shaves, .etc!***

If you are interested in an appointment the shop is not difficult to look up on google maps and you can always PM me here and I can set you up as well, just PLEASE make sure to only set an appointment with either myself or one of the other barbers that are currently prepared to accept it.

EDIT:

P.S. Probably should go without saying, but we go by the prices shown on Coinbase Pro and will be making sure the value of the amount sent is based on the prices on Coinbase Pro only at the time of sale.

We made one for BTC, LTC, DOGE and ETH.

We hope that you all find it helpful.

This is terrible lol. Almost every crypto is ""peer to peer"", almost every crypto is ""decentralized"", there are ALOT of cryptos with ""limited supply"", and there are plenty more cryptos as fast as or faster than ""4x""
This shows why LTC is better than Bitcoin. Trust me, I love LTC, am invested a decent amount, and believe in the future. Every current can make these arguments."

32	MY 2 LITECOINS ARE GOING TO THE MOON WITH ART!!! ¬£170 ($235) PER COIN...	1615738016.0	725	"Hi everybody, I am new to crypto and Reddit. I did my research and fell in love with Litecoin and its potential. With WM, Paypal, low fees, and being what I think is undervalued I believed this was the coin for me and I wanted to be part of the journey...

I carefully watched the charts go up and up, got a Coinbase account after a 6 week validation process, I witnessed solid gradual growth, chuckled at the memes and I knew it was my time to strike.

I purchased 2 coins on Feb 19th 2021, this gave me an average coin cost of ¬£170 ($235)

FOMO got me. I wanted in. I then watched the price fall about 30%.

Yes, I am your typical noob and had no idea how volatile the market can be, however, this has not put me off Litecoin as I am here to stay and hodl no matter what. These 2 little coins are taking me to the moon!

To pass the time I decided to make some Litecoin art to promote our adventure, not only is it a good way to get our coin some exposure, it also stops me checking Coinbase every 2 mins.

If you would like to support me to continue making these images please consider buying me a coffee with the link below. Any support will be thrown right back into Litecoin to help bring down my average coin cost and fuel our journey to the moon!

&#x200B;

 

If anybody knows how to send donations in Litecoin that would be even better as I really do think this is the future!

So, to recap:

I like the coin

I am not a cat

And when will Litecoin reach ¬£1000? Any day now :)

I know times are tough, so if you cant afford anything and like the picture that's cool, have a great weekend and hodl strong together!

FURTHER ART IDEAS:

Would you be interested in me producing this art in postcard form so I send them to your friends, neighbours, colleagues and enemies? Just think, every postman in the world would be exposed to Litecoin with a hand written message by me informing them of our beautiful future currency!

Also, would you consider sponsoring an image by paying to have your name / Reddit handle as a tiny star in night sky, showing how we are all together on this Litecoin rocket to the moon?

Thanks, this is my 1st Reddit post and you guys keep me smiling.

Anyone else have a feeling Litecoin is about to take off in the next month or two? Like maybe even double or more? I just have this gut feeling with mimblewimble getting close and compared to 2017 the ratio is way off as well. Its a very well known coin and is going to have privacy which is in super high demand. No one wants the government to know every single transaction they make. We need a well known digital cash. Plus its one of the first cryptocurrencies,  so eventually when they are all mined they will be somewhat of a collectors item as will bitcoin. Its definitely alt season right now too! Anyone else have a gut feeling about LTC going up?

Edit: I think in 2024 the mining difficulty goes up as well. I am trying to get as many as I can before then. Just a small guy , but I bought a whole litecoin just yesterday to add to my small collection. Once they are all mined I can see it going parabolic.

It's too late to look back now like ""damn LiteCoin was  $9 2 years ago"" well yeah BitCoin was $8000 a year ago too. 

LiteCoin being about $170 right now is a bargain.  It's gonna feel like we all woke up one day and it's gonna be $3,000.

54	Apart from Bitcoin no other crypto in history has stayed in the top 10 longer than Litecoin	1619562815.0	582	"That's neat.

Creation Date

* Chainlink - 2017
* Polkadot - ~2017
* Binance Coin - 2017
* Ethereum - 2015
* Cardano - 2015
* Stellar -   2014
* Tether - ~2014
* LolDogecoin - 2013
* XRP - 2012
* Litecoin - 2011


Sooo, outside of XRP/doge, over 100 weeks on Litecoin's tally is meaningless, non-competitive ""pad"". 

How about the date that each coin passed LTC on the top-10, and how long they've remained above it vs. their creation date. I can't access the site right now for in-depth data but easy google searches show LTC dropping below coins from 2015 onward (lost #2 to ETH in 201~~5~~6). 

How many weeks has each coin listed in the ""current"" top-10 been above LTC in market cap?

Cherry-picking stats is fun!

Edit: Alright, got home, can sit and do numberwang now. All data pulled from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQJg2-v-A0Y).

Wow, I was actually off my guess. XRP beat ETH in taking LTC off the #2 spot. The week of 21 Sept 2014 is the first time LTC lost it's #2 spot, only regaining it in Nov of 2015, then fight with XRP from Nov to Dec 2015, before dropping back to #3-4 until it's final drop from the top-3 in July of 2016, never to return. ETH rocketed past LTC in Jan 2016 and then into it's currently-held position of #2 in Feb of 2016.

* Ethereum - Held Top-10 since Aug 2015, #2 position since Feb 2016. Passed LTC Jan 2016. (Not even close)
* XRP - Held Top-10 since July 2013, fought LTC through 2015, ahead of LTC since 2016. (Almost 4x market cap, has been 5x at times.)
* Tether - Actually took a bit. Didn't creep into the Top-10 until 2018, and fought a while before settling comfortably into the top-10 in 2019 and then climbing through the year until un-seating LTC in Sept. of 2019. (3x market cap.)
* Stellar - Came to play hardball early 2015. Got knocked around pretty good by a bunch of shitcoins that no longer exist and was knocked out of the Top-10 in 2016. Came roaring back at the end of 2017. Moved up over LTC in July 2018. Dropped back in Feb 2019. Lost it's Top-10 spot in early 2020. It has never recovered.
* Cardano - June of 2020 to Top-10. Jan 2021 above LTC. (2x market cap)
* Dogecoin - Can't make me

Don't care enough about the other ones. Watch the youtube if you're interested. 

A favorite stat of mine: Feb 2018 compared Feb 2021

2018

* BTC - 178B cap
* ETH - 84B cap
* XRP - 38B cap
* LTC - 12B cap
* ADA - 8B cap

Edit 2: *For transparency's sake and to further drive home the point, here's Feb 2019, deep in the crypto winter*

* BTC - 65B cap
* ETH - 14B cap
* XRP - 12B cap
* LTC - 3B cap
* ADA - Not present in the Top-10

2021

* BTC - 854B cap
* ETH - 166B cap
* ADA - 40B cap
* XRP - 19B cap
* LTC - 11B cap

Pretty much sums it up. What happened to those bottom two coins since 2011 and 2012? [One's in a battle with the US government](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/22/cryptocurrency-firm-ripple-expects-to-be-sued-by-the-sec-xrp-plunges.html)/considered worthless by many within the crypto-space but *somehow screamed back to the #4 spot in market cap*. LTC saw it's creator [sell his entire stack near the ATH](https://thenextweb.com/news/litecoin-charlie-lee-coinbase-trading) and then get to deal with [insider/bot trading rumors/conspiracies on a major exchange.](https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/coinbase-insider-trading-litecoin-edition-be64ead3facc)

Edit 3: We sit in the full-swing Bull market right now, end of April, 2021, even after a ~knarly correction. *Someone explain XRP to me holy shit.*

Its great to see Charlie making the rounds again. He may not be the best at public speaking but the simple fact that LTC's creator is still representing the project is a big deal to me.
This is a great share! Good to see @SatoshiLite still in the public eye.

The comments on the YT for this are remarkably toxic. 

Bitter people still mad because Charlie sold $LTC. Sad to think people will hate someone because they did well for themselves on something they created.

Not appreciating the fact that he‚Äôs still been developing and promoting $LTC even after taking profit. That profit is likely what made it possible for him to keep developing and promoting. I imagine it has allowed him to remain the director of the $LTC foundation."

-------------------------------

[I think /u/shaharlazaad said it best](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/nuestq/super_happy_to_announce_that_my_small_black_owned/h104mqx/). The many trolls in this thread claim that discrimination against race doesn't exist, because they don't see people's race. They claim that black people are using the ""race card"" instead of trying to understand that maybe other people have different experiences from you. All this yet we see clear-cut examples above.

Historically in the United States, black people have been oppressed. Maybe the blacks aren't slaves anymore, you think. So why are they complaining? I grew up poor, and I am not black, and yet I don't whine as much. This is an extremely simple-minded attitude. It's all about the history...

Segregation and redlining stopped black families from purchasing homes and land in 'desirable' areas. Yet this doesn't happen today, so clearly there's a level playing field, right? You forgot the part where black families were prevented from building generational wealth.

At least one person claimed that black people choose not to open business, and it's just a choice at the end of the day. Anyone who has ran a business knows that a lot of it comes down to connections. African-Americans were legally limited from starting businesses, until after being emancipated. And the very few who took on the heavy risks to start businesses had to do so with no connections, in a racist society where white people would avoid black owned businesses, because they were black. Due to this, the vast majority of black-owned businesses were small, and ran on razor thin margins. Let's not forget the Tulsa Race Massacre, which at the time was the wealthiest black community was looted, burnt and destroyed. Then the Great Depression happened, and the worst hit were the smallest businesses, of which many were run by black people. 

Whilst it's quite unlikely for a black person today to experience anything like this, black people have limited capital and networking. To see a black-owned business succeed is quite rare, and this is why many black people take pride in displaying it!

---------------------------------------------------------

All that being said, this is the Litecoin subreddit. Today we saw hundreds of heavily upvoted comments unrelated to the post or the subreddit. Many of it encouraging hatred of black people. This is absolutely unacceptable! The worst offenders (exampled above) were permanently banned. We are here to encourage the adoption of Litecoin as a payment medium. We are not here to argue over if racism exists, or what ifs. All you had to do was not comment, yet we had a giant thread of idiots doing exactly the opposite of what they claimed to be against.
That's cool but what does being black have to do with anything?

Congrats on your investment. Litecoin is the most undervalued crypto in the market. Everytime I need to transfer or convert funds it has always been LTC that does the transaction quickly and cheaply. I'm talking fees of 18 cents compared to BNB BTC or ETH fees of $15 - $25 for the same transaction.

Even if there‚Äôs no cap, there are still ways to control inflation. Look at Dogecoin, the inflation rate shrinks every year because a constant amount of new Doge is added to the supply each year (unlike the Dollar where the inflation rate is ‚Äúconstant‚Äù every year)

>January Progress:

>We were able to get Grin++ ready in time for the hardfork, which went smoothly. That was the final planned fork, so Grin++ is back in maintenance mode, and should no longer be a distraction for the remainder of this project üöÄ

>The bad news ‚òπÔ∏è - I was not able to get the automated windows build ready, so I did not kick off the community-wide testnet this month like I hoped.

>The good news üôÇ - The delay was mostly a consequence of a new proposal by Tevador (lead developer of RandomX) called MingleJingle[1]. MingleJingle is another design for providing non-interactive txs in Mimblewimble, and by far the most detailed one yet. Tevador was able to use his extensive experience with Monero stealth addresses to make a number of improvements on our design (LIP-0004). The benefits of his design for sub-addresses[2] and output encoding[3] were immediately obvious, so I decided to switch gears for a bit and use what I learned from MingleJingle to improve MWEB addressing and output structure[4].

>The big advantage of this new addressing scheme is that we no longer have to ‚Äúgrind‚Äù through different possible stealth addresses when restoring from a wallet seed. With my far-inferior design, the wallet would have to scan the MWEB utxo set and attempt to restore using the private keys once for each stealth address. So if you generated 10 different stealth addresses in the past, it would scan the UTXO set 10 times, which could take several hours after a decade of MWEB usage. While stealth addresses allow reuse without leaking information about your transactions, if you wanted to maintain several identities with a wallet (lame example: multiple pseudonyms on a site like litecointalk.io that each advertise a donation address), then each identity would still need to generate its own stealth address, resulting in these long scan times. But with Monero‚Äôs subaddresses (and Tevador‚Äôs improved version), we only have to scan each UTXO once, regardless of how many stealth addresses you‚Äôve generated in the past ü•≥

>Some more good news üòÄ - After finishing the new addressing improvements, I took another pass at the UI and transaction history display and found a number of ways to make it easier to follow where funds are moving. One change I made was to add a new column for MWEB amounts in the transaction history, so peg-ins & peg-outs look a little more intuitive:

>https://i.imgur.com/8QijfhI.png

>The code is now ready for the new testnet, which we can launch as soon as we‚Äôve get a working windows build. If anyone has experience setting up automated builds of bitcoin or litecoin for distribution on windows (preferably using Github Actions, but any CI would be fine), I could really use your help! Come chat with me at Telegram: Contact [@MWEB_Testnet](https://t.me/MWEB_Testnet)

>The great news ü§©- There are still a ton of ways we can (and will) continue to improve the MWEB code, in particular around syncing, but most of what remains is not required for initial launch. So I think I‚Äôm finally ready to commit to a code-complete* timeline‚Ä¶

>üç≠ üçï ü¶Ä I will be submitting the code for review on March 15th. ü¶Ä üçïüç≠

>This will contain all of the consensus, P2P, and wallet code necessary for supporting MWEB. The only thing it will be missing is the activation code, which I will add after the reviews and audits are all finished.

>\* Code-complete means ready for developer reviews & formal audits. It will not be ready for activation until after all reviews & audits are finished.

Edit: You can use something like [cobo tablet](https://shop.litecoin-foundation.org/product/cobo-tablet-litecoin-branded/) or a steel plate to etch your 24 words for long term piece of mind if you a worried about losing your recovery seed.
Binance holds cash deposits for 10 days I think. So you won't be able to send your litecoin out of your binance account until 10 days from when you deposited the fiat to buy the litecoin with. Take that time to learn about wallets and find the one that is most suitable for what you are looking for. Also be careful about clicking on links to wallets posted by users, could always be some kind of scam.

LTC is good, very stable.. But we're in the ""wild west"" or new territory with the boom of cryptos becoming more and more available. I see the big becoming the main hubs while other currencies that are linked to those larger chains being the more volatile, risky trades.

>March Progress:

>The first code review[1] was submitted on March 15th covering the libmw project! üöÄ This is where the bulk of the MWEB logic resides, and is completely independent from the existing LTC code in order to make it easier to take the latest fixes and enhancements from bitcoin.

>MWEB is a massive enhancement, much larger than any previous upgrade to the LTC network, including SegWit. Not surprisingly, there is a ton of code to review. libmw alone is more than 15k lines of code, and that‚Äôs not including the ‚Äúglue‚Äù that ties it into the existing LTC code. Reviewing all of this, and getting it professionally audited is going to take us well into the summer, so please be patient with us all as we painstakingly pore over each line to make sure it is safe and bug free.

>The consequences of introducing a bug in consensus code can be quite severe, sometimes even catastrophic. Grin recently suffered the worst kind of attack due to a consensus bug[2]. One of the 2 node implementations used a cache improperly, which led to an invalid transaction being included in a block. This transaction massively inflated the supply for a short period of time. Luckily, Grin++ did not have the bug, so the issue was caught and fixed right away. Forks of Grin were not as lucky‚Ä¶

>While I‚Äôm certain MWEB will not be vulnerable to any major attacks, the Grin experience was a bit unnerving for me personally. I want to make sure we‚Äôre doing everything we can to eliminate possible sources of bugs. The biggest such source is rushing through code, which is something I‚Äôve done a lot of this past 2 months üò¨

>As a result, I will no longer be committing to exact deadlines. I obviously value transparency a lot, and want to keep everyone as informed as possible, so I will continue to provide estimates (now, in an easy-to-follow timeline at https://wenmweb.com ). But these will be no more than estimates, subject to change at any time. This project is too important to rush.

>April Tasks:

>This month, I will be working on cleaning up LIP-0002 and LIP-0003 based on feedback we received from one of our auditors. I will also be addressing comments on the libmw code review, and continuing to add more tests and documentation to make life easier for reviewers, auditors, and future maintainers. I‚Äôll also be reaching out to more auditors, bitcoin developers, and mimblewimble experts to solicit their review of the design and code.

>These next few updates will mostly just involve the same few things over and over: documentation, testing, review, and general housekeeping tasks. But I‚Äôll take advantage of the briefer updates by describing the various perks of MWEB, future directions we can take it, cool projects we can build on top of it, and general reasons why bitcoiners should and will be jealous of Litecoin ≈Å

They are mined together.  Doge uses litecoin chain to secure its network.  They both use the scrypt algorithm.
Script miners are creating 14.4M new Doge every day. The more traditional ones, more technical minded, or anyone mining on litecoinpool.org are selling off their Doge for LTC as fast as they mine it. This creates an upward pressure on the price of LTC.

With 14.4M Doge minted per day @$.40, that's $5.76M basically being pumped into the price of LTC daily."

A friend of mine who recently asked me for advice on crypto asked me where he could buy crypto. Let's call him Joe. I told Joe to to buy it on an actual crypto exchange and avoid Robinhood but he still proceeded to buy it on Robinhood likely because of the zero fees that is falsely advertised. Like what's the point of asking if you're not gonna listen? Joe was also told to buy crypto in 2018 when it was trading in accumulation prices but he did not listen either.

My firm belief is that people need to make those mistakes themselves before they can truly understand the 'why'.
Robinhood announced that they are implementing crypto deposits and withdrawals. Also, Robinhood is required to back crypto purchases with a 1 to 1 physical asset. Therefore, your purchases are actually affecting supply."

190	Could someone plz give their honest and un-biased thoughts on this? I'd post in /bitcoin but they aren't in a good mood now..	1621785993.0	211	"That seems pretty accurate to me. Power concentrates, and there is no way the banking industry is going to roll over quietly and die. They will develop the means to control crypto the same way they seize control of everything else.

They will utilize the principles of marketing to promote their tech, even if it's inefficient, and they will prosper.
Honest replies? perhaps.  Unbiased replies? unlikely.

The critique is valid, but I think some of the darker analogies are a **little** overwrought.  If you value the importance of a decentralized base layer, then infinite scaling on-chain is probably a no-go.  What do you have left?  A L2 solution (or some close facsimile) is a valid option.  I personally think LN is a great attempt.  It adds channel dynamics into the mix and, despite the (inherent?) possibility for channel centralization, allows users to manage their channels as they see fit.  More intelligence in the LN clients will automate this process.

Something I have seen is a real world schism developing between Tor LN nodes and clearnet LN nodes, particularly for Litecoin.  Obviously, as the regulatory fight is waged, the technical freedom afforded by running base layer chain nodes and LN nodes over Tor will provide a little relief, but could we see two separate and almost disconnected ""economic systems"" - specifically on the LN side of things?  So that ""cut-off from the network/graph"" argument is a real concern for me and I see nascent hints of that happening already.

Lightning Network is an option and right now I think its a fair option for balancing tx speed and scalability.  Litecoin expands out the BTC style hard money network sphere (scalability) and works beautifully, but will only go so far.  How many more established, safe, liquid, hard money networks are there really and how many times do you want to jump chains just to move assets, especially payment type assets, something LTC excels at?!

p.s. I totally understand the sentiment in /bitcoin right now (and everywhere in crypto for that matter).  The past 4 days have seen a serious escalation in the fight.

edit: The original critique fails to mention the fact that a single channel can route payments to any other reachable LN node.  Theoretically, you can open just one channel, for better or worse, and be done with it as long as you are willing to pay additional (absolutely minuscule - on the order of 1/10,000 of a penny) routing fees.
What makes you think we are in a good mood? :)"

If you‚Äôll recall, LTC works by spending coins you‚Äôve received before and creating new coins of equal or lesser value for another user‚Äôs address (and change back to yourself). The process for selecting which coins to spend is incredibly complex, since poor choice of coins can lead to paying excess fees or serious privacy leaks. In fact, it‚Äôs so complex that bitcoin developer Murch wrote his 67-page master‚Äôs thesis about that single topic[1].

>Up to this point, we hadn‚Äôt needed to make many changes to the coin selection logic, since we were either sending LTC coins - in the case of a typical LTC transaction or when pegging-in (sending LTC coins to an MWEB address) - or we were sending MWEB coins - in the case of an MWEB-to-MWEB transaction or when pegging-out (sending MWEB coins to a LTC address). This was relatively straightforward to implement, since it meant simply applying Murch‚Äôs algorithm to the available LTC coins (for LTC-to-LTC or when pegging-in) or applying Murch‚Äôs algorithm to the available MWEB coins (for MWEB-to-MWEB or when pegging-out). There was no ‚Äúmixed‚Äù mode where some LTC coins were sent with some MWEB coins.

>That all changed when I wanted to add the ability to automatically peg-in/out without requiring the user‚Äôs knowledge of how that works. Now, we could get ourselves into all kinds of weird scenarios. If a user decides to send to an MWEB address, the wallet first checks if they have enough MWEB coins to just send them in a normal MWEB-to-MWEB transaction. If they don‚Äôt have enough, then we check if they have enough LTC coins so we can just create a peg-in transaction (LTC-to-MWEB). But if they have 5 LTC coins and 7 MWEB coins, and they want to send 10 coins to an MWEB address, then we have to create a mixed MWEB transaction which spends some from the LTC side and some from the MWEB side, creating a sort of partial peg-in tx.

>And it gets even worse‚Ä¶

>If we change the scenario to wanting to send 10 coins to a LTC address, but they only have 5 LTC coins and 7 MWEB coins, we actually can‚Äôt just peg-out (MWEB-to-LTC) 5 of those MWEB coins and combine them with the 5 LTC coins. Due to the structure of the transactions, we actually have to peg-in those 5 LTC coins, combine them with the 7 MWEB coins, and then peg-out 10 of those. Doing this all in one transaction and deciding the best coins to use - all while trying to minimize changes to the existing LTC codebase - has kept me up for weeks. So much for ‚Äúquickly‚Äù adding that in üòÜ

>So if anyone is looking for a master‚Äôs thesis topic, consider going with An Evaluation of Coin Selection Strategies for Mimblewimble Extension Blocks üòú

>Moving on, I finally figured out the coin selection logic, and started doing some manual testing of the new code. Immediately, I started finding all kinds of weaknesses with the wallet code that simply weren‚Äôt a problem when we didn‚Äôt have mixed/partial MWEB transactions. So I had to rethink the entire design of the wallet (fortunately, the much-more-critical consensus code remains in great shape).

>To make a long story short, I rewrote about 80% of the MWEB wallet code to support mixed-coin MWEB transactions. While I tossed around the idea of launching the testnet in parallel without this new functionality, the wallet rewrite more than burned through all of the buffer I had left in the timeline. The time I would‚Äôve spent supporting the testnet certainly would‚Äôve delayed the March 15th code-complete deadline.

>But the good news is we‚Äôre (mostly) back on track again! üí™
I guess I‚Äôll just kick the can a little bit further down the road, and shoot for launching a community testnet sometime after the code is completed this month. There‚Äôs still a ton of work left to do before the code review can be submitted, but I remain confident & committed to meeting the March 15th goal.

>TL;DR:

>  Testnet deprioritized again (yikes!)

>    Coin selection kicked my ass

>    Still shooting for code-complete on March 15th

221	What‚Äôs this about - same trend across the board	1613426946.0	177	"The whole market is inextricably linked at the moment. Different coins often follow the exact same path. I find this particularly true after a dip like last nights one (I.e not a major dip, and recovery happens over the course of the following 12-18 hours)
This is how crypto works. Everything rises together, everything falls together. When BTC has a ridiculous year, alts have a ridiculous year. When BTC goes sideways for three years, the whole market goes sideways for three years. Obviously there is *some* variation, and that's why some days one coin will climb the charts at 58% increase, but most of owning crypto (if you're in it for the long haul) is watching everything on coinmarketcap be green, or everything be red. I'd say 98% of days will look like the pic you just posted.

This isn't because of some crazy conspiracy, it's because the crypto space is still so small and the investors are pretty much the same across all projects. And the same adoption that heartens supporters of one coin, does the same for supporters of another project. This also means that the idea of a ""diversified"" portfolio made entirely of crypto is pretty much a joke. I mean, yeah go ahead and invest in a few different projects knowing that some good ones will fail and some bad ones will succeed - ""diversification"" in this sense is a good idea, as it will lessen the change of you missing the boat entirely - but don't for a second think this equivalent to a diverse portfolio of real estate, gold, some stocks, bonds and cash. It's not even equivalent to buying some tech stocks, some defense stocks, some finance stocks and some industrials. Crypto is it's own thing entirely.

And yeah for the most part, 98% of the time LTC will do exactly what BTC did that day, which was exactly what ETH did that day, which was exactly what some shitcoin ranked 420 on coinmarketcap did that day.

BUT you're here and you're holding not for those normal days. You're here and you're holding for those 2% days. Those days where for no fucking reason at all LTC goes from $60 to $379 in less than 1000 hours.

That's a blink of an eye in LTC's 9.3 years of existence, but if you were around in Q4 of 2017, that blink was where you made your nut.

I know none of this is what you asked in your post, but the content of your post made me think you'd benefit from a bit of perspective. This whole thing is like sitting at poker table where there is no ante. There will be a lot of boring hands where nothing really happens, but every once in a while, you'll get incredible cards. That's sort of whats going on in these few months, we're getting a run of great cards. But eventually that will stop, and some people will get bored and leave the table, and others will try to force something that just isn't there and they'll get burned for it. For now though (and altseason, in the words of Dennis Reynolds, hasn't even *begun* to peak) we're getting a few good hands and even the idiots at the table are looking like geniuses. I know for sure I'm one of those idiots. What keeps me from being a broke idiot is going to be later when it slows down for another 2-3 years and I'll have to know that it's ok to just keep ""checking"" until the table gets hot again because at this table, ante's don't cost anything.

Good luck! Hope this doesn't come off as too patronizing. Just trying to help you realize more quickly that most days are going to look like the pic you just posted.

As this fledgling asset class becomes a full on portion of the global economy, sound assets will appreciate, period. If one recognizes btc, Ltc is recognizable hard money/sound asset too. Quality will always win, sometimes it just takes longer.

Continued adoption/use cases helps. Thats all it really needs, that and time.
It's a no-hype coin, for better or worse. It's old and people want the next big thing. There's definitely no ""army"" or maxis shilling it. The creator is a relatively low profile dude from what I can tell.

I think it will increase in value long term as more people/businesses use the blockchain to transfer money. That said, it would possibly need the endorsement of lots of big names (in every sector) before people got interested.

>Documentation

>I‚Äôve re-written LIP-0002 based on feedback received. The revised version is available for review [here](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/pull/15). The LIP-0003 re-write is still in progress.

>I‚Äôve also improved some of our code documentation, and will continue to do so over the next few months.

>Coding & Testing

>[Hector Chu](https://github.com/hectorchu) has helped a lot these past 2 weeks with testing & coding. He tested the major flows and quickly identified & helped fix a number of bugs. He has also helped with adding functional tests to cover some of the untested & under-tested consensus rules.

>I‚Äôve been working through the litecoin side of the code, and doing my own pre-review of the code before submitting it for review. I was able to clean up a lot of the validation and mempool logic to harden it against attacks, as well as fix some bugs in the wallet code.

>Reviews & Audits

>Hector has finished his review of the libmw code[1]. I‚Äôve addressed a number of the issues he found, and will continue to work through that list over the next few days.

>Once the code for Litecoin‚Äôs v0.21 release has been reviewed, I‚Äôll merge all of the MWEB code into that branch and submit the 2nd and 3rd code reviews (2nd=validation, mempool, & mining code; 3rd=wallet code).

>I‚Äôve also reached out to Quarkslab with the hope that they‚Äôll have capacity to audit the design & code.

>[1] https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/pull/703 

>Instead of going over May‚Äôs tasks, which are going to be more of the same, I promised I‚Äôd discuss something fun about MWEB instead.

>One thing that was proposed to Grin earlier this year by John Tromp was a ‚ÄúCoinSwap‚Äù service. If you‚Äôve got a decent understanding of the math behind mimblewimble, then I recommend reading his proposal [here](https://forum.grin.mw/t/mimblewimble-coinswap-proposal/8322).

>This CoinSwap proposal aims to improve transaction unlinkability, much like a CoinJoin service does. But existing designs for MW CoinJoin services have a few important limitations. One is they currently require trusting the CJ server operator to not leak your transactions (there may be ways to eliminate that trust, but none have been found yet). Another is that using CoinJoin services have more annoying UX, since you must wait for the CJ server to aggregate enough transactions before the large CJ transaction is finally broadcasted and confirmed on chain.

>CoinSwaps merely swap a single output for a different one of the same value (minus a very small fee). There‚Äôs no need to link any of your inputs together, risking revealing your identity to the CJ server operator. And you don‚Äôt have to trust any single server to preserve your privacy, since that trust can easily be spread over a large number of CoinSwap servers, with the requirement that only one of them needs to be honest in order to protect the privacy of all of the participants.

>And this can all happen behind the scenes without any user interaction! When your wallet identifies new coins that were sent to you, it can automatically send those coins to the CoinSwap service to be trustlessly replaced with a different coin, so that once they‚Äôre mixed, even the person who sent you the coins won‚Äôt even be able to tell when or if you‚Äôve spent them. The same can be done automatically for your change outputs when you send coins, or can just periodically be done by your wallet to ensure you‚Äôve got clean coins.

>The design appears to work as is, but I‚Äôm optimistic it can be improved even further to allow dynamic selection of coinswap operators. In its current form, the coinswap server list must be static. But if we allow the ability to easily add coinswap operators, you could always just add an additional one if there‚Äôs ever any fear that the existing servers have been compromised.

>It‚Äôs worth keeping an eye on CoinSwaps. They help eliiminate Mimblewimble‚Äôs greatest weakeness (transaction linkability), and can easily be integrated into MWEB wallets, which means this is an excellent opportunity for someone to build a profitable business, while improving LTC‚Äôs fungibility at the same time.
Great to hear privacy is coming to LTC. Is there any thoughts on improving LTC within existing Defi networks? Either just more partnerships or more functional operations in existing networks.  Defi is the biggest thing since the invention of crypto. Wrapped LTC is barely on LP platforms. Any additions to improve Defi integration would be huge.

The real parameter for LTC is the ratio of 24 hr volume / market cap. or the turnover of LTC

$9,500,892,829 / $14,937,132,500 = **0.63**.. This is insane. If means a LTC is spent every 1.58 days 

Look at XRP (claimed to be the banking crypto) :  
$7,588,343,938 / $ 24,842,463,572 = **0.30**  It means  it takes more than 3.33 days for an XRP token to be spent

The reserve crypto (BTC) is

This is the one piece of advice I wish I had listened to when I first got in.
1.) Open Coinbase account and link your debit or bank account for deposits/purchases 2.) Choose assets u want to buy and purchase 3.) Hold in Coinbase wallet or if u have ledger or Trezor transfer to there *bonus 4.) When u open a Coinbase account u have access to Coinbase pro which is there trading platform and there u can purchase the assets u want at a cheaper fee. That‚Äôs all u need to know the same 1-4 steps are similar for other exchanges. Do not purchase from binance. I would only do Coinbase/cpro or Gemini ‚Äîholding on exchange means keeping on the platform u bought them. Cold storage is like a wallet u own like ledger or trezor, etc.
Don't trust anyone that seems too nice or eager to help.

Always verify your addresses before sending any amount of money.

I am working on a cryptocurrency tracker as some of you have have seen since I post here sometimes.

After getting a ton of requests on these two features, they are now live on app store.

It is now possible to favoritemark currencies in the toplist to make them sorted to the top so that you as a user don¬¥t have to scroll all the way down to what you¬¥re interested in.

It is also possible to enter the average cost of which you bought your currencies at to track the profit/loss of your portfolio.

I have also made the news a little prettier by webscraping the links I receive from google rss to get images.

As always, no sign up, no ads, no in app purchases and completely anonymous with firebase.

I expect the Android update to be live in a week or two.

I¬¥d love some feedback and suggestions on what you think can improve the app. Thanks :)

269	Why Litecoin?	1624223300.0	138	"LTC is one of the first altcoins ever, it has survived every fud, bear market, .. and it remains one of the best store of value in the long term.

It is not meant to compete with BTC but to team up with it. It's like gold (BTC) and silver (LTC).

With its low transaction costs, it is possible to use LTC to buy coffee just as it is possible to use BTC to buy something that has a higher price (a house, car).

In terms of features, LTC is becoming fungible. It will soon be possible to transfer funds anonymously thanks to MimbleWimble.
From a practical perspective it is similar to bitcoin but slightly quicker blocks. Uses a different mining algorithm, not sha256 so there is no competition for mining. Litecoin and dogecoin are merge mined so as ltc block reward decreases doge is continued to be mined at same amount, benefit for both communities. Ltc will be getting optional privacy that further kicks the can of scalability down the road. Ltc has no big mysterious bag holder that has a stash of coins (if the matters to you). Probably the most equitable distribution of coins. Everyone loves to hate on LTC but it has had staying power for the last 10 years. LTC is a no fuss coin that just works, there are no address and memo. Works the same as btc so if you know how to use btc you can use ltc. Supported at most ATMs. Also has lightning network. Idk there are lots of coins and I think there will be space for lots. There is definable scarcity like bitcoin a pretty big network. People love to hate on Charlie selling the top which is fine. For myself it does t matter to me whether he holds coins or not as the currency will be bigger than Charlie. He strives for adoption, not price. Which is admirable and still develops. Lots of people say there is no development because GitHub is empty but they have their own forum for development litecointalks. It is not a flashy coin and it not the newest but it has so far stood the test of time and after the next halving will be noticeably scarcer
I've recently sold all my litecoin after finally accepting that there's nothing particularly unique about it. I wanted it to do well since I've held since 2018, however,  IMHO there are better investments in the crypto market."

Yeah, it‚Äôs not BTC and never will be, but that‚Äôs OK.  LTC is great for payments.  LTC has wide adoption, almost everywhere you can use BTC you can use LTC.  It‚Äôs fast.  It‚Äôs cheap.  It‚Äôs based on Bitcoin but does not in any way pretend to be the ‚Äòreal Bitcoin‚Äô.  Halving works differently than it does in BTC though, so watch out for that.
You're upset there are no LTC shills? Listen, no one is ""in it for the tech"" so when flavour of the month alt coin has ""conversation"" know it's hollow and some youtuber gave the drones talking points to regurgitate because they need the next idiot to buy their bags. Which yes leads to short term gains but LTC hasn't been in the top 10 consistently along with BTC because it's a shilled coin."

Litecoin can handle 4 times the transaction volume that Bitcoin does. Same blocksize, but four times as fast. For a while it also scaled slightly better than BTC because of Segwit.  Segwit transactions are smaller.
It should always be cheaper to use than BTC even if network activity were the same."

Marketcap shows XMR is doing well,so two friends asked my thoughts. Here's what I had to say;
XMR is having trouble getting listed on regulated exchanges that require kyc/aml. There may be cross chain Dex's but without liquidity it'll be hard to succeed. XMR has competitive advantage with MW but will likely lose to a coin that does that plus has liquidity, ie LTC+MW

They are not going to just be like oh, LTC, let‚Äôs scrap BTC and redo EVERYTHING we just had done to implement this other form of crypto. This is a whole piece of land not a small business they aren‚Äôt changing now. Also, a decision this big I guarantee they explored all options before implementing. I see where you coming from but not feasible.
Could you elaborate on the why?

I like Litecoin alot but it is not better for their country. It is a 9 billion asset with only 1,3 billion volume. It would probably only take 50mill or less to pump or crash the price 10-15% in an hour and 30% or more in a week if you want. So it would be extremely risky for a country to make Litecoin their currency when it is so easily manipulated by individual people, companies or other countries. For this reason alone it cannot be done. When Litecoin is a 500billion asset we can suggest it for a few smaller countries.
I'm sure that will make them change courses"

Litecoin will hit that number and and much more !
Remind me in 5 years !
""...but I just keep arriving  at the fact Litecoin is the future cryptocurrency household payment  system .""

Sorry, but disagree here. LTC is the same as BTC, just 4 times faster. It will run into the same problems as BTC. 2nd layer solutions will once be needed for LTC, too, IMHO.

So use your sunday wisely, set up that LTC Lighning Node and connect to mine: 02dd523a144ae8549ada8b624bd256b4f9892cc184ce7f6acee1a7336ae2a9525e

And do not expect to make any money out of it.

""Does anyone have any evidence of any other cryptocurrency that  has a more sound and trustworthy track record than Litecoin?""

Nope! 

It's basically the same code as BTC. Which is a good thing! Meaning, the code developed by the brightest minds in the space can be used for LTC, too. But it has a different hashing algorithm, so no attacks from there."

Along with almost everything in Blockchain at the moment. Until I see my parents using it I won't be convinced of full adoption.This is probably a great time to be accumulating, everyone is to concerned with booming to ATHs and down talking LTC that's the signal to load up and buy it cheap and take a punt. DYOR
This is my first post on this subreddit, but I love Litecoin for moving money around. I don't have a giant heavy bag, but I keep a reserve on hand at all times for when I want to move in/out of an exchange or making p2p payments with crypto friendly people I know personally. 

I love bitcoin of course, but I hate moving it around these days. Litecoin is way faster and the fee is not even worth mentioning. I know some people are telling me Stellar is better for the situations I describe, but LTC has such robust markets on pretty much every exchange, and lots of direct pairings. Rarely a problem sending Litecoin to instant exchanges to get a fair rate on whatever coin you want. I also like that as far as blockchains go, it is very simple and familiar.

That's just me though, and I'm old school shitcoiner. 

LTC will pump, it's tradition.
Last I saw, it was finished but is doing some testing I think?  That being said, assuming coins are regularly added and removed from the market as people are making use of MW, i dont think it would create a bullish concept as much as you would think.  Ideally, it would follow Charlie Lee's vision of increasing throughput though, which in turn, creates intrinsic value, which would create desire.  I dont think the increased use as others buy and sell from other currencies would solely do it.  As upon transaction completion, they would instinctively return to their currency of preference.  I think the value which would be useful across all currencies would allow us to obtain a large amount of new users, which is fantastic."

> Great technical people, but can‚Äôt market themselves out of a paper bag.

Anyone is free to volunteer at the LTCFoundation. If you think you can help, please contact us with your CV at contact@litecoinfoundation.net.

I can assure you I was here through the last bear cycle and I‚Äôll be here through the next one too.
But you have to recognize that paying to promote Litecoin adoption through various means (like the Dolphins, UFC, etc) seems like a waste when free publicity opportunities are passed up. I‚Äôm just saying that if this were any type of for-profit business, they would be singing about this accomplishment from every rooftop. But most of the time the Litecoin Foundation seems to be way to conservative with their approach to promotion. Why is that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LitecoinMarkets/comments/m5c8s9/daily_discussion_monday_march_15_2021/gr2n45v/)

I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with parts of your comment, and yes, we have many that criticise but refuse help. They want to reap rewards for seeds they did not sow.
To many Litecoin or crypto is just a short term thing, but to us at the Foundation it is not. I‚Äôve seen so many come and go, and to me (no offence) you are just another.
I understand that you may not have time, but to me there seems to be a consistent trend among those who criticise during bullmarkets. They never want to help!
This is even the case for donations. As part of our mission to be decentralised, there was never any premine, nor any centralised tax/fund. So we ask for funding through donations. Yet the vast majority of donations always comes from a consistently dedicated small group of people. These folks aren‚Äôt big ‚Äòwhales‚Äô either.

> It doesn‚Äôt exactly build excitement when the last piece of code that was promised is committed at the very last minute.

You are misreading this. MWEBs code has been ready on David's local repo for some time. However before launch code was cleaned up and documentation was been written. David's been in a crunch to complete this as every software team would've been before a big new feature was in. The March 15th deadline was only recently self-set by David.

>	paying to promote Litecoin adoption through various means (like the Dolphins, UFC, etc) seems like a waste when free publicity opportunities are passed up

These ‚Äòbig‚Äô sponsorships like Dolphins and UFC etc are fully funded by Individuals for the benefit of the Litecoin Project.

As we are a real non-profit, all donations and profits through apparel/partnerships/etc are invested into future projects. We have rules that we have to abide by, and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre conservative. That being said, we are consistently trying to improve our marketing.

We know that we have great Twitter & Reddit reach. However we are trying to grow on other platforms like Facebook, and Instagram. We‚Äôve also made a big push to get people to sign up for our monthly newsletters. Internally we are improving other things which directly address your original complaint.

309	Kicking Bitpay Into Submission - Is It Finally Time They Accepted LTC?	1622649882.0	120	"I know it's embarrassing, but I think this is political because Roger Ver was an early investor in the company and wants to stop usage of Litecoin to make BCash look better. He knows if Litecoin is added it will quickly become the dominant payment option alongside Bitcoin. And the reason they added Doge is because Mark Cuban told them they had to add it or he'd find another payment processor for the Mavericks.
Because of political reasons. This goes back to the big block wars of 2017.  Basically their CEO Stephen Pair chose to back the anti-bitcoin faction (roger ver, jihan wu etc) and coopt bitcoin into increasing the blocksize. But they dun fooked up and lost. Now they're salty and refuse to accept better alternatives, which is costing them money. Accepting litecoin would mean bitcoin cash would lose because they know 80%+ of their customers would immediately switch to litecoin if they had the chance. If they want to run their business into the ground to spite bitcoin then that's fine with me. So be it. Lol.

Same here. Though I do keep asking why LTC doesn't get any love and people mention that Charlie Lee sold all of his coins as a reason why he doesn't believe in its longevity. That's ridiculous, because the creator of dogecoin made it as a joke, and it's blowing up right now. He literally didn't believe in Dogecoin, but it's shooting up.

315	My litecoin experience and future thoughts.	1601054024.0	116	"I bought my first litecoin at $351.94 in December of 2017. I should have grabbed that $4 gain when I had the chance.
hopefully we break 100 again in the next 6 years
LTC is just practicing edging, when it explodes to a new ATH you'll see."
316	Litecoin is Looking Really Good Right Now And Here‚Äôs Why	1625154442.0	112	"The title of this article is more bullish than the actual content.
If it goes below $100, I'll buy more.
Litecoin will bounce back once the market/BTC bounces back.  We are all dependent on Big Brother, at least for now."
317	Litecoin topic on game show trivia question on The Chase with James Holzhauer	1610763945.0	114	"The answer given is incorrect. Litecoin (digital silver) is not a rival to Bitcoin (digital gold). Litecoin is complementary to Bitcoin and is seen among many including me as Bitcoin's little brother. Both can coexist helping each other along the path forward.
Dude won a lot of money for knowing that bit of trivia! Also long time since I‚Äôve heard of name coin.
Litecoin emerged as a rival to namecoin not bitcoin lol. Namecoin was premined scam coin though looking at the landscape now premined coins are all the rage apparently so the namecoin scam was to ahead of it's time, a real innovator."
318	Litecoin is proud to support NASCAR driver Landon Cassill	1623942258.0	115	"Landon knows what sound money is.

Landon's response.. priceless"
319	How LTC help BTC onboard new users. My personal experience	1614635589.0	115	"Thank you for doing what you do! I firmly believe in the use of litecoin as an alternative currency for daily use transactions. It‚Äôs great to see that you as a business owner is leading the charge
Great story, keep doing this great job manüòÉ

320	Litecoin ranks 65th when compared to the world's largest banks in terms of market cap	1610080036.0	114	"Why is litecoin not hitting ATH when BTC and ETH did
And climbing.. 63rd now!
 Because you didn‚Äôt buy enough."
321	PayPal Announces Plans to Sell BTC, LTC, and ETH Directly to Customers	1603287466.0	113	"Huge news, and important that Litecoin is included in the first round of coins. As we know, Bitcoin is more like digital gold with high fees, people will think in terms of whole coins, and gravitate towards the lower priced coins that are meant for daily payments. Ethereum also has high fees and not meant to be used as a currency. Then add in MWEB and CTV next year, just solidifies Litecoin's position as the best payment coin by far. I can't believe some people are getting discouraged about Litecoin.
Paypal: please note if you buy through Paypal you don't own the crypto as you don't get the secret key. Paypal remains in control.
I‚Äôm a fan."

https://litecointalk.io/t/mweb-progress-update-thread/26678/243

>June Progress:

>#Documentation

>I‚Äôve spent some time documenting all of the code changes to assist our auditors. For those interested, this is the current list of technical documents describing the MWEB changes (several are only partially complete):

>*[LIP-0002](https://github.com/DavidBurkett/lips/blob/lip-0002-improvements/lip-0002.mediawiki)  - This describes the process for adding extension blocks to LTC, including describing how pegging-in, pegging-out, and integrating transactions work

>*[LIP-0003](https://github.com/DavidBurkett/lips/blob/master/lip-0003.mediawiki)  - This is our original design for Mimblewimble extension blocks. It‚Äôs a bit outdated, but should provide a high level understanding of how it works.

>*[LIP-0004](https://github.com/DavidBurkett/lips/blob/master/lip-0004.mediawiki) - This describes our approach to supporting one-sided txs, instead of relying on interactive transactions like traditional Mimblewimble

>*[LIP-0005](https://github.com/DavidBurkett/lips/blob/master/lip-0005.mediawiki) - I‚Äôm still filling in missing data structures here, but this documents the P2P protocol changes and describes how MWEB transactions and blocks are serialized

>*[Consensus Rules](https://github.com/ltc-mweb/litecoin/blob/mimblewimble/doc/mweb/consensus.md)  - Not a comprehensive list, but describes the most important consensus rules

>*[Kernels](https://github.com/ltc-mweb/litecoin/blob/mimblewimble/doc/mweb/kernels.md)  - Describes how kernels are serialized, the various features that are supported (e.g. lock height), and how new features can be soft forked in later on.

>*[Data storage](https://github.com/ltc-mweb/litecoin/blob/mimblewimble/doc/mweb/store.md)  - Describes the new database tables and data files that were added

>*[Stealth addresses](https://github.com/ltc-mweb/litecoin/blob/mimblewimble/doc/mweb/stealth_addresses.md)  - How stealth addresses are generated, how we support subaddresses, how addresses are serialized, etc.

>*[Pruned Sync](https://github.com/ltc-mweb/litecoin/blob/mimblewimble/doc/mweb/syncing.md)  - Describes how pruned sync will be supported in future releases

>#Coding & Testing

>I performed my own review of all of the node logic to look for ways to improve security and performance, which resulted in a number of improvements to the code & design:

>Kernel MMR is now per block, instead of a perpetually growing MMR. It was determined that we don‚Äôt gain much by having a cumulative kernel MMR, so switching to a per-block MMR means less time spent hashing, and a lot less disk space needed to store the MMR.
>Switched from sha256 to the much-faster blake3 for all MWEB hashes.
>New stealth address format that‚Äôs more consistent with previous address types, along with having better error detection.
>More compact serialization formats for all MWEB data structures which will result in less disk space usage, less data transferred between peers, and therefore slightly higher throughput.
>Better test coverage

>#Audits and Reviews

>I‚Äôve officially handed off the final code changes and documentation to Quarkslab, so we should have a more detailed timeline from them any day now.

>I‚Äôve created a new [code review](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/pull/738/files) with the most critical changes to the litecoin consensus code. It‚Äôs much smaller and more focused than the libmw review from a few months ago, so hopefully we will get more reviewers and faster feedback from other devs.

>I‚Äôve made slight changes to the estimated timeline on wenmweb.com , but overall, we‚Äôre still working toward MWEB activation at the end of the year.
Interesting, we continue to follow"
326	customers of the ledger hardware wallet device are targeted using new sophisticated methods. This recent video breaks down the latest method involving sending customers a fake ledger wallet.	1624041617.0	110	"Buy your ledgers directly from the site
In my opinion this is just a video trying to devalue the wallet so you can buy a different one from another company, or he is simply just trying to help out everyone in being aware of the fake ones out there that have shit installed on them. Great wallet though and I personally never had any problems with my Nano X, the only problem is the iOS app moving slow. OP also downvoted my comments so it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs against Ledger users lol.
Not new"
327	Privacy on Bitcoin via MimbleWimble & Litecoin	1615260326.0	111	"Why would anyone swap

BTC -> LTC -> Extension Block -> LTC ->BTC

to use MimbleWimble when they can just Atomic Swap

BTC -> Monero -> BTC

It‚Äôs easier and better privacy.
When atomic swaps over LN?
So to get the privacy, users swap to LTC, get the privacy and swaps back to Bitcoin?

Wouldn't it incur more transaction fees as compared with users just using coin join tools like Bitcoinmix and others?"
328	Mimblewimble Progress Update Thread - July	1627986267.0	109	"https://litecointalk.io/t/mweb-progress-update-thread/26678/258
>July Progress:

>#Coding

>I‚Äôve shifted away from writing new code so the MWEB codebase can remain stable while the auditors perform their review. I‚Äôve been focusing instead on rebasing our changes from the LTC 0.18 branch to the LTC 0.21 branch.

>For those unfamiliar with git terminology, what this means is we started with the code from the LTC 0.18 release (the latest at the time), and have been coding MWEB on top of that. However, LTC 0.18 is no longer the most recent code, since the release for LTC 0.21 is nearly ready. So I‚Äôm merging the MWEB code we wrote onto the LTC 0.21 codebase so that we still have all of the latest features (like taproot) in our MWEB release. This is a manual process that can be very tedious and time consuming, since code changes that were made in LTC 0.21 could interfere with the changes we made to support MWEB. These conflicts must be carefully addressed individually, which has been taking up much of my time.

>Fortunately, I‚Äôve finally got all of the node changes merged and building successfully. I‚Äôm working on fixing some failing tests, and then I will start doing the same thing with the wallet code. Once that is all finished and reviewed, we should be able to make a pre-release to start testing how the code works on mainnet. In particular, we‚Äôll focus on making sure it communicates fine with older nodes, validates and propagates transactions & blocks, does not prematurely enforce MWEB rules before activation, and is able to successfully mine valid blocks.

>#Reviews & Audits

>Members of the team developing [Tari](https://www.tari.com/)  were kind enough to spend some time to give a high-level review of the design & code. They provided us with their findings [here](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/s/7Ht_tBxlr#) and [here](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/s/7F9l45zHu#). In addition to finding a few potential issues, they‚Äôve also thoroughly documented their understanding of the changes, which can serve as a useful resource for others trying to learn about MWEB.

>Also, we received the official audit proposal from Quarkslab, which we‚Äôve accepted[*], so they will be officially starting their audit in just a few days. This is expected to wrap up by mid-October, when we will be provided a report of all findings. Once we address the issues found, we‚Äôll be able to create an official release (release number TBD).

>[*] Thorough auditors like Quarkslab can make all the difference in the success of a project. Unsurprisingly, this means they can be quite pricey. By ‚Äúwe‚Äôve accepted‚Äù, what I really mean is Charlie has, since he generously chose to pay for this audit. We are very fortunate to have him around ‚ù§Ô∏è

>I had to take some time off this month for personal reasons, so my update was a little lighter than we‚Äôve been used to. Things will be back to normal next month. Thanks for your understanding.
wtf is up with this ltc site... shouldn't have to jump thru hoops
Good stuff guys, glad to see progess being made. Thank you David for all your hard work and thank you Charlie for funding the Quarkslab audit."
329	My coins got stolen	1617197297.0	109	"Just learn from it bud. 
I learnt early on from a game called Endless Online all the different shades of scammers. As a child I must of fallen to 100s of scams..(in the game) 
As an adult I'm suspicious of everyone online, for instance I didn't even click your links because it could be a trap (Yep).  
Adopt the paranoia.. it can save you at the worst of times and be a slight annoyance at the best of times.
Never trust a website just because it uses HTTPS. All HTTPS means is that example.com is indeed example.com, it only means anything if you trust example.com to be a legitimate website in the first place. Also, pretty much anyone can get a free certificate nowadays using Let's Encrypt. At least a few years back a scammer would have to pay a bit for the certificate, now they don't have to do even that.
He didn‚Äôt steal  your coin you gave it to him."
330	@DavidBurkett38: 1/n Despite huge LTC gains, only 0.25 LTC were donated this month :( - I know the original plan was to complete MWEB in 12 months, and we're now about to start month 14.

I don't see LTC fulfilling that role sadly.  


The  path I see for it, is as a literal BTC lite. I.e. used for institutions and investors. It is a robust and solid blockchain, adequately decentralized, and known secure. Many of these traits are good for institutions who might miss the BTC train, or need the things LTC does better, but I don't see a general medium of exchange in LTC, as a dumb know-nothing.
I am really banking on this.   May be in 10 years, it will go 4 or 5 digits.  so far have like 20 ltc and stacking as much as we can.
Litecoin may not be used as a currency down the road. It might be used as a rare savings bond that gains in value as demand increases due to its limited availability. Then you cash that bond in for the cryptocurrency of the future, like Doge to be spent on day to day things."

Don't spam! Instead talk about MWEB to your IRL friends who're also into crypto. If you know anyone at a crypto news company/ or anyone influential, talk with them in real life.

First anyone in crypto needs to be educated about MWEB and Litecoin adopting MWEB. Then regular people will talk about it.
Don't spam please but informing is fine. One of the great things about Litecoin is that people kind of leave us alone. The community generally doesn't attract gamblers and is more focused on technical discussions than pointless hyping to the moon. Don't get me wrong, we obviously get excited when it goes up, but I like Litecoin because it's one of the few coins where you don't see people everywhere going ""BUY LTC GO GO GO!"" every two seconds. I don't want to attract those people or become that personally.

Also just a side note I made a [writeup of my thoughts on Litecoin](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lh24vj/i_feel_like_all_the_new_users_maybe_dont_see_the/) on a general cryptocurrency sub and crossposted it here purely to be informational and I was temporary banned and the post removed because it was seen as brigading (which is totally reasonable and I respect that decision even though it was not my intention).

I have worked with Charlie for years now and we are all working much harder than 2017 because of his work working with partners and promoting the use of LTC. 

And, I agree..LTC is the best for moving money around.  It's dirt cheap to transfer and it's really quick...seconds from Litewallet to Litewallet. Minutes from an exchange.

Unashamedly biased.
Every time all the cryptos go up, I adjust the %column and see which top 10 coin is doing best. It's almost always litecoin. My lead investment by far, I am amazed by the hatred for it. People love to hate on litecoin. Litecoin is definitely the best cryptocurrency there is, and no one will change my mind. Dependable, cheap, low low fees, super fast... the list goes on.
The origins of LTC are a big part of it. It was basically a copy/paste of BTC, with parameters changed. BTC was first, so it leads the charge in these extremely early stages, and it's much better known.

Very few people hate LTC, most people just don't think about it much."

355	Why is Litecoin attractive?	1614076542.0	98	"One major point of interest is legality.

It‚Äôs no secret that PayPal invested in BTC, LTC, BCH and ETH.  But what most people probably don‚Äôt realize is that those are the ONLY four cryptos that the current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler [once listed as passing the ‚ÄúHowey Test‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/TXg1mIt.jpg) in his 2018 paper. ‚ÄúThe Impact of Blockchain Technology on Finance: A Catalyst for Change‚Äù.

This isn‚Äôt a coincidence, PayPal knows what it is doing. They are playing it safe, they‚Äôre going with coins that they don‚Äôt think will ever have regulatory issues.

Again, out of thousands and thousands of cryptos, LTC was one of the few that was specifically named as being most legally compliant with US laws. This is worth keeping in mind for long term investments.
Grayscale has a trust set up for it and is hoarding Litecoin in droves. Sometimes they hoard more Litecoin than they do Bitcoin and Ethereum. It‚Äôs their third largest asset.

Litecoin is fundamentally similar to Bitcoin in terms of things like disinflation rate and halving cycles. The only major differences are the circulating supply, block time, and algorithm (Scrypt vs SHA-256). Therefore, it‚Äôs easier and more comforting to speculate that Litecoin‚Äôs price will spike up in a certain way by looking at Bitcoin‚Äôs historical price vs its disinflation rate.

It‚Äôs undervalued compared to what it should be worth (compare the Grayscale LCTN trust premium to LCT market price), but people are starting to notice that. Grayscale hoarding it is making people slowly wake up and start getting into it.

80% of it will be mined this year. When 80% of Bitcoin was mined in 2017, it‚Äôs price exploded by 19x in that year alone.

Paypal will support Litecoin as one of only 4 cryptos they‚Äôre currently suppoting, so its going to be useful for more than just gambling.

Litecoin has stayed in the top 10 list since its inception despite some new kids on the block like BNB, ADA, and DOT that I never heard of kicking it down a couple places. I am hoping for this trend to reverse.

This is something I find attractive, but its designed as a compliment Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù as ‚Äúdigital silver‚Äù. No other coin is really designed to take that role.
LTC is catching some peoples attention.  A lot of people are using it to send funds in between exchanges right now.  Of course there are other crypto's that can do that equally well, but for now LTC is universally on nearly every exchange.

>May Progress:
>Coding & Testing

>We‚Äôve made the following significant improvements to the code over this past month:

> 1.   Unified the build process to support existing release strategies. We originally intended on sharing the libmw codebase with Grin++, so the new code used a different technology (cmake) for managing builds than the existing litecoin code.
    That plan turned out to be unworkable due to significant differences in the Grin and MWEB protocols, so there was no longer a reason to continue using 2 different build management solutions.
    We‚Äôve stopped using cmake entirely now, and just include the libmw code as part of the existing (automake) build. We‚Äôve also downgraded from C++ 17 to C++ 14 to support gitian builds, which is how we generate verifiable releases.

> 2.    Removed superfluous interfaces and boilerplate code. This also stemmed from the fact that we no longer need to share logic with Grin++.
    We had a rigid interface layer that prevented us from calling the existing litecoin code from within the new libmw library, which resulted in the need to duplicate serialization, logging, and other infrastructure code within libmw.
    Since litecoin is now the only consumer of libmw, we were able to eliminate this artificial separation, resulting in less code (and hopefully fewer bugs) overall.

> 3.    Working automated builds for multiple platforms. The automated builds are working again for linux, and now also a windows build is being generated with each code commit.
    This has allowed for quicker feedback from changes, and opened the door for non-developers to help out with testing without needing to build the code themselves.

>Reviews & Audits

>We‚Äôre still struggling to get developers to review the libmw code. The code has changed quite a bit since the PR was first submitted though, so I will likely be closing it and creating a number of new, smaller, and hopefully more digestible PRs over the coming weeks.

>I met with Quarkslab yesterday to discuss what we need audited, and I will continue to work with them over the next week or two while they gather what they need to do their initial assessment & estimate for the audit.

>We remain on track for activation around the end of the year, barring no major surprises from the auditors

1. Litecoin is faster but sacrifices security. It sacrifices in two ways: shorter block times and less hashpower than the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is far more secure, but slower.
2. Litecoin mining uses scrypt instead of SHA256. This isn't terribly important but it is worth considering for a few reasons. For example, Bitcoin miners cannot direct their hashpower towards the Litecoin network, whereas they could direct it towards something like Bitcoin Cash. This means things like BTC miners can't switch to LTC nor attack the network. Relevant because BTC network has so much hashpower. The biggest takeaway here, I suppose, is that LTC mining exists outside of the ""game"" with the biggest player (BTC mining)
3. Developers might do something unique with Litecoin to make it different than Bitcoin. So far, they haven't. But I guess they could."

A lot of misunderstanding and misinformation here...

ETH is not really a transactional coin. Especially right now with the gas fees being as high as they are. Comparing ETH to LTC is like comparing an Apple to a pizza.

ETH has smart contracts and a whole network of DAPPs. LTC has neither of those. 

Just like you wouldn't use a pogo stick to commute to work, you wouldn't use ETH as a transactional currency right now. ETH however provides value in the form of being a necessry utility and the network effect mentioned above.

ETH 2.0 and sharding will fix the gas fees. As well as layer 2 solutions for things like UNI. 2.0 has been rumored to be tentatively scheduled for October with the Shanghai hard fork. UNI L2 is May I belive.

They are going to open up the service worldwide at the beginning of this year and expand the service to their mobile app Venmo.
But PayPal is just selling fractional reserves of coins. We dont know that buying LTC via paypal will have any effect on the market price. What's driving the BTC bull run is the amount of funds being taken off the market by HODLers creating scarcity. While LTC is deflationary the same way as BTC, it just doesnt have the same amount of rallying support. If we see BTC shortages we'll probably see people flock to ETH and LTC as functional alternatives to fiat currencies. We'll just have to wait and see though.
hard to disagree with this and why im mostly in LTC. 4x the supply of btc but 1/250th the price? yeah gtfo. ltc will be 1k before people realize."

381	Hi, I‚Äôm Brad from Unstoppable Domains. Very excited about our recent integration with Litewallet so I‚Äôm here to answer all your questions about blockchain domains - AMA!	1610722652.0	92	"Is it possible to receive payments of multiple different crypto currencies, eg; BTC, ETH, LTC, on one single unstoppable domain address?
Hey Brad, Thanks for doing the AMA.

You've spoken a few times about this being good for decentralized systems and being ""censor-proof"". Do you have any concerns about drawing in crowds of content that may be morally reprehensible (CP, hate speech, terrorism, etc).

Given the current issues we're seeing with Parler and AWS it seem pertinent to the conversation. I can understand the desire to not be the gatekeeper/judge of content, but the reputation that any company may gain, especially if they become primarily known for that content, may be concerning.

Without getting political, let's use CP as the example. Does UnstoppableDomains have any concern or plans for what to do if they become known as the ""domain provider for CP"" similar to how the Tor Network's primarily gained a reputation for the unseedy?


I like the idea of Unstoppable Domains especially for simplifying crypto addresses, and think that's a great use-case. While the idea of uncentralized domains is also valid, I worry that by trying to cover these two use-cases under the same project, there may be a cross-contamination that prevents the first from being useful as well.

Cheers!

382	Avoid PayPal crypto	1605712784.0	92	"How can it be ""suspicious"" when it's bought and ""sold"" both on their Plattform... absolutely ridiculous dickmove by PayPal.
You are dealing with paper crypto, obviously everything will be at their discretion. If you want full control of your money, get a real wallet and better exchange.

That doesn‚Äôt mean PayPal is bad, it has its role in crypto. It allows the masses to trade crypto with fiat which legitimizes it as a store of value.
I can't believe anyone trusts paypal. They've been ripping people off for 10+ years."

More than most would believe, the amount lost from people dying or forgetting their keys could be several million.
I would say less lost as a percentage than bitcoin, since LTC had a market value from the get-go unlike BTC. 

On the other hand maybe people secure their alt coins less thoroughly than their bitcoin."
400	What does the future hold for Litecoin?	1612795164.0	85	"Litecoin is like the ugly girl in the movie who is actually really hot, but nobody notices until she takes off her glasses and puts her hair down. 
By that time it's too late to start wooing her because now everyone has seen how hot she really is, and so everyone is interested. 
To have a chance with her, you had to have been friends with her before she was ""hot"". 
We're the friends. 
Don't worry, they will figure out how hot she is soon enough.
I normally don't share my opinion with randoms since I'm a developer and not a financial advisor, but I think Litecoin is bound to go up.
 

I already have BTC and looking for coin other than BTC. I pick LTC, here is why:

1. LTC is a finish product : if there is no more development at all from now on, LTC will still up and running for very long time as store of value like BTC. Is always good to have alternative to BTC because not everyone need to move hundred of millions/billions dollars. Normal people like me can move hundred/thousand dollars with smaller fee and faster transaction with LTC. Most importantly it is super secure.
2. Security : LTC use script algorithm while BTC use SHAH 256. Both of them DOMINATE in their own algorithm. (that is the reason why LTC is more secure than Bcash) prove of work is more resilience than prove of stake. BTC/LTC history prove that.
3. BTC/LTC is highly unlikely to be replace by others : To be able to duplicate BTC or LTC, such chain need to have at least years of incubation period that no one attack it. Those day are long gone. Any new prove of stake (fair launch) coin will get attack form the most sophisticated hacker/entity from day one. Therefore BTC/LTC are the HIGHLY SECURE prove of work coin that we will have for the foreseeable future.
4. Fair launch and no pre mine : All existing coins are either mine or purchase. No entity has free coin or pre mine to benefit themselves. Not even Charlie.
5. Open, Public, Borderless, Neutral, Censorship resistant. (From Andrea Antonopoulos )

Howard Marks once said : The reason we can make big gain in asset is because very few people are looking at the asset. No one expect it will have a bright future, therefore the price reflect their opinion. If we can find something that has very little hype and most likely will survive for the foreseeable future, that will make us huge gain.

In my humble opinion: beside BTC, LTC is the one who I have confident that it will survive for the next decade. LTC has no single point of failure, unlikely to have bug in the code. Even though tomorrow Charlie run over by a bus and LTC will still survive and running as usual. ( sorry Charlie, you will live long enough to see the success of LTC)

P/S : I hold 50% BTC, 30% LTC, 20% ETH since 2017

I only do portfolio balance at the extreme ratio.

I hope this will help some new comers that interest in LTC. If you have doubt about LTC, zoom out and you will see more clearly.

Cheers!"

**In order to promote LiteCoin,**   
No camel-casing please it upsets my stomach   
**First thing we can do is decide the primary and main website for Litecoin. As per wikipedia page, we have 2 website i.e. litecoin(dot) org and Litecoin (dot) com .**  
We struggle to maintain one site as our team are volunteers and or very busy. The sites do meet some goals (non-crypto folks is .com) (techie folks like .org) Each group are not wanting to visit the other site.

  
**Second thing, show goddamn Whitepaper, it‚Äôs almost non existent on website.**  
There is no white paper except Satoshi's. If you think that matters, you need to read read the white papers aside SN's of the other long standing cryptos...you will be shocked.  
**Third thing, Show the core team who are currently developing LTC on website.**  
Are you demanding?  
**Fourth Thing, memes and dank memes, Meme will enable masses to understand more about Litecoin.**  
üöÄüçÄüòÖ  
**Fifth Thing : LiteWallet and the card shouldn‚Äôt be US exclusive, we can expand to more countries.**  
Not up to us...contact Ternio  
**Sixth Thing : Option to personalise the Litecoin Card, hire some good designers to make Chikun Arise cards/LitCoin üî• Cards, etc . Or some similar community theme.Even Sir Charlie Lee‚Äôs twitter cover of DBZ goku and vegeta as btc and ltc is dope.**  
Not up to us...contact Ternio  


  
**Seventh thing : More YouTube and Social Media Presence, quirky and witty social media replies would be lit. Kinda like Wendy‚Äôs old dank twitter posts, sarcastic comebacks and replies...**  
Please apply to volunteer  
**Eight Thing : Litewallet UI can be little more simplified, it does the job but aesthetics and speed can be improved a bit.**  
Tooootally agree!  
**Ninth Thing : Emphasize updates such as MimbleWimble and many other LTC features such as that card, speed, tps, digital silver,how it‚Äôs like a little brother and similar to BTC etc.**   
**Highlight the applications of LTC. Share facts of LTC on twitter, clear up some common misconceptions and FUDs that always revolve around LTC.**  
**This way, Chikuns will Arise and we‚Äôll be on moon. And hopefully my comment will go down in good books of History.**

Lower fees, faster, mimblewimble coming soon (which in my opinion will be a major catalyst for growth, especially for libertarian leaning folks, that are quite present in the cryptoverse) and most of all, we have Charlie  Lee giving huge credibility to LTC. It takes away the shadiness other altcoins have where the devs hold 20% of the supply.

Value always bubbles to the top, things just gotta be shaken up from time to time. My final price target in 5-10 years will be the rightful conversion of 1BTC = 4LTC. This is where supply is leading us, only demand has to catch up.
I bought 30 ltc for 240 per coin in 2017 then i bought 10gs worth in when it was around 80 dollars. Still holding on to them. I know eventually it will rally like last time. Good luck to you as well. See you on the moon bud lol

As more large entities take in silver as a store of value similar to bitcoin to Compliment their bitcoin holdings.. thats when litecoin will sky rocket in price.  Long term holders who didn't fall for the internet meme hype will be rewarded for their correct observation of this. 

If you want to market litecoin, doing it as a store of value that has the qualities to be digital silver will get more people on board.
Anything we can do as a community to improve LTC should be considered, but anything that could make it a pump and dump puppet should be avoided.

We have to incentivize adoption through spreading the LTC culture and think of new ways to bring it to people out there. I am all for getting active as a team and work it out."

I think all the other cryptos that are being meme'd and rising without explaination are going to drop as soon as the attention dies out. Classic pump & dump, just a new way of doing it. That's probably what's happening. We don't want that with LTC. I'm okay with the slow & steady growth we have. It's nothing insane, but when the insane growth does come, it'll be much more rewarding because we got there without propaganda! lol

I have really started to believe litecoin is digital silver to bitcoins gold.  Based on how litecoin was created, network structure, limited supply, I'm beginning to be very confident in my feelings toward this.  I actually really like that litecoin is one of the most silent, longest standing cryptos out there.
You know what it is, all we hear are the mad lads lately, but Litecoin is full of silent knights and i like it.

Joe Rogan is a joke and embarrassment. 

So many people in the crypto forums are the greenest of green ‚Äòinvestors‚Äô. Stop wishing for pumps- they are ultimately destructive. Spend time learning instead of trying to cheerlead. I‚Äôm far from an expert in the crypto space but Ive been trading for 30 years.  I‚Äôm concerned a lot of people buying crypto are going to lose a lot of money bc they don‚Äôt understand trading or valuation.

Physical bitcoin will be some of the most sought after collectables in the world. Their rarity and beauty are second to none. Currently the most expensive  one in the world just sold for millions, a cassius 1000 bar. Nobody knows about them. As bitcoin climbs the frenzy will happen. I recommend buying the physical bitcoin encyclopedia. Ive been buying and selling for years
I think the buyer funded coins will eventually be more desired. Once the money is on the coin it cant come off unless you pull the hologram and ruin the coin. Ive seen the lealana coins jump 10 fold in price in the last 12 months."

it might be the fees that you pay for the transaction 0.00000112 ltc.
I doubt it has anything to do with the fee. Litecoin blocks aren't full so fee doesnt matter unless it's lower than the lowest allowable fee somehow, which seems like you'd have to try really hard for that to happen.
Probably not enough fees, might be because you sent from a segwit to a legacy wallet. 

I don't know the timeout for the mempool but there are 2 options that will happen if you just do nothing 
1. It will be removed from the mempool eventually and you get the ltc back 
2. Your tx will go through once the queue is done and no-one pays higher fees aka the coin has some breathing time"

It is well-established, reputable, fast, easy to use, convenient, well-accepted, and has a max supply only 4x BTC's total supply. The word undervalued really applies to Litecoin.
When all people can own is like 0.0001 BTC, they will seek out more LTC. Both have same properties but different supply limit. People will use them as store of value.

I think when CBDC‚Äôs come out... i think people will use those coins to spend instead. Just speculating here.

""A lot of people think I quit Litecoin because I have no incentives to work on anymore. But it's kind of the opposite because it's my baby, so to speak. It's my legacy.""
[removed]
I think Charlie has a lot of incentives, I remember the time when he sold all his LTC in Nov-Dec 2017. So pretty sure that he is still very incentivized.

452	Why does it seem the most expensive things in life seems the most worthless	1620443231.0	72	"Actually, your money can't be exchanged by gold anywhere, unless you buy the gold. That's been this way since Breton woods, the gold standard was then replaced by the gold exchange standard (an agreement in which countries fixed their exchange rates to the dollar that was supposed to be printed according to the U.S. gold supply - $35 per ounce of gold).
Now-a-days fiat currencies ain't backed on these physical assets anymore, their value are mainly determined by the financial situation of the country that prints it and their monetary policies.
Agreed; however, the worthless paper is backed by a standing army, nuclear weapons and the ability to shut the internet down.

Litecoin is proof of work, so you'd have to buy Skypt ASICs and burn some electricity... your business might bee better served buying LIGHTNING nodes and accumulating satoshis, then when transaction fees get expensive you can do fee arbitrage for your clients

457	Litecoin's path to Interoperability, potential velvet fork and smart contracts.	1605621448.0	72	"This is why I am still very invested in Litecoin. A coin that keeps real promises reachable and keeps updating and upgrading.
Just finished watching it and was very pleasant to learn how elegant and simple this solution is. 

What are the next steps from now? A testnet ?
Instant synchronization, which will boost client experience, backward and forward compatible, miners can accept both blocks, smart contracts verified securely and fast via ‚Äúsuper block‚Äù mechanisms of the NIPOPows.  Truly decentralized smart contracts, no oracles or federations with possible incentives.  As long as LTC POW Algorithm stays the same and SPV continues to work, no risk to upgrades or developments like MWEB.  This could be remarkable for both networks!"

3) It‚Äôs being used by the BTC devs as a mainnet testnet for large changes in segwit.

There is lots of other things great about it but for me these ones seem to be the ones brought up the most in this discussion.

The Litecoin Foundation is well respected and works hard on making Litecoin a global currency

It's one of the chosen coins by PayPal and Grayscale, meaning big companies see it as a solid play
Everyone hates on litecoin, that's probably the #1 thing we are known for.

All the other shitcoins hate on litecoin as hard as they can as if they could somehow add to their coin's utility by detracting litecoin.

Number 2, people will never shut up about ""Charlie Sold The Top"" even tho he really didn't, he sold multiple times, and disclosed that in the interest of being transparent. Charlie didn't want to get in trouble with the SEC or other gov't agencies by tweeting shit and pumping the price and having them investigate him or whatever.

Third, Litecoin is a clone of bitcoin, and all the haters call it testnet.  It's basically bitcoin, but it uses scrypt for the hashing algo instead of SHA256. scrypt is ""memory hard"" vs SHA256, meaning you need more RAM to crunch the numbers for scrypt than SHA256. Idea was it would make Litecoin ""ASIC Resistant"" and Litecoin could be mined with CPU/GPU or general purpose computer hardware. That was true for like 2 years, by 2015, scrypt ASICs dominated the hash rate of litecoin.

As much as Dogecoin thinks it's so cool and everyone should use it, they would literally be dead if not for litecoin, as auxpow hashing is what keep doge alive. People ""merge-mine"" litecoin and dogecoin at the same time, so you have a chance to mine both coins at the same time with the same hardware. 

Solo mining dogecoin wouldn't be profitable with any hardware, since everyone else is mining something else as well.

Litecoin is mostly scandal free, it's a fair launch (unlike ethereum, which had a huge pre-mine of coins given to the founders), there is no ""satoshi bags"" where a billion USD worth of bitcoin has never moved, but who knows, someday satoshi might return and spend those coins. 

Major benefits? Litecoin can be used in almost the exact same manner as bitcoin, it's generally the #2 accepted alt coin, behind ethereum, and generally is included whenever more than ""just bitcoin"" is offered. 

Example: Paypal included litecoin in their announcement, if they hadn't, well I think that would have been the death knell for litecoin. Seriously litecoin is strong, but it's been treated like the bitch of crypto for years.

For technical users who aren‚Äôt afraid of CLIs, and are willing to build the code themselves, I encourage you to join in on the fun by going to https://t.me/MWEB_Testnet.

>The new home for the code is at https://github.com/ltc-mweb. For those of you unaware, MWEB is now the new official acronym for ‚ÄúMimblewimble Extension Block.‚Äù It‚Äôs so super official, that we‚Äôve got an awesome logo and everything! Check it out: https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1311376460158955521.

>Going Forward:

>Now that the MWEB testnet is running, I‚Äôm going to focus on ways to make it easy for non-technical litecoin users to start testing it out as well. This means improving the automated builds, better documentation, and starting to build out wallet support.

>Right now, there are a number of areas in the code that are fragile or lack the necessary validation around edge cases, so I‚Äôll also be taking some time this month to harden the code, and start validating any remaining consensus rules we missed. Once I‚Äôm confident everything is working as designed, I‚Äôll start looking for ways to break the testnet, to make sure we find and resolve any security or stability weaknesses.

>Next month, I‚Äôll share a detailed plan of all of the remaining work necessary to get MWEB merged to the main repo, so that miners and node operators can start signaling for activation sometime in 2021! üòÑ

Litecoin has been in the top 10 cryptos for 9 years (ever since it was created). People are salty that their 'innovative' coin that they FOMOed doesn't have the giant market cap that Litecoin has.

Their coin isn't really innovative. Usually it's just a bunch of hype of impressive sounding technical talk, which will never be implemented. This makes the creators of these shitcoins rich.

Today I read something on /r/Cryptocurrency about how NFT technology were going to replace music labels. This just doesn't make sense, and comes from a naive understanding of what a music label does. These people often have no idea what they bought into and just repeat marketing-speak.

1. Ether would take first place in market cap because it is second place right now and like Bitcoin, it leads by a huge amount.
2. Litecoin would probably grow because many people are not interested in Ethereum and other smart contract coins.
Bitcoin having a wallet that large mass sell off would cause the entire system to collapse for a while and plunge all altcoins in to the depths of hell.

501	If bitcoin moves largely to lightning, what is the point of Litecoin?	1621312546.0	62	"Because Litecoin also has it's own LN and will always be cheaper to use. Also people aren't going to spend digital gold in day to day transactions even if it's possible, so they will want to use the next best thing which is digital silver.
You seem to be combining the ideas of digital silver/digital gold, store of value, and transaction speed/efficiency/scalability all into one. They‚Äôre separate things and keeping them separate will help me answer your question. 

Yes, digital silver stores value and so does digital gold, yes digital silver is currently quicker and cheaper as a currency. But there‚Äôs so much more to the BTC/LTC dynamic than just efficiency.

Even if Bitcoin became way more efficient through wide adoption of the LN, it will still have slower block times and thus slower confirmations. (People still don‚Äôt want to wait 30 minutes for 3 confirmations for non-LN transactions). Maybe it‚Äôll also have cheaper fees, but probably not. Also, there‚Äôs the psychological fact that BTC is very expensive and some people would rather have 1 whole of something rather than .003764829 of something. And, eventually, BTC could be worth more than $1,000,000. Who wants to buy into something if they‚Äôll never in their life be able to own a complete unit it when they could buy something similar for cheaper and get a whole unit of it?

LTC being a complement to BTC works great for right now. It fills the voids left by BTC‚Äôs flaws. Will that dynamic still be a thing 8-10 years from now? I don‚Äôt know. Nobody knows.

But Will BTC even be able to change for the better over the next 8-10 years? That‚Äôs a better question. BTC is very slow to change, and if there is change it splits the community. Litecoin is quick to change and it doesn‚Äôt split the community... we‚Äôve got mimblewimble coming and nobody even batted an eye. 

So the litecoin/Bitcoin dynamic isn‚Äôt just about the day to day payments. There‚Äôs many more factors at play. And even if Bitcoin became the best choice for day to day payments, I still think there would be a place for LTC, for the reasons noted above.

Also, I answered a similar question here, if you‚Äôd like to read more: https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/nbz1d6/discussion_viability_of_litecoin_on_the_technical/gy2fc6v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

504	What's causing litecoin to go up today??	1615584474.0	59	"MimbleWimble code completion March 15th :)
It‚Äôs because I sold my LtC yesterday. I sell, it goes up. Happens every time.
My best guess is that people are finally looking at Litecoin as a player in the business and because it‚Äôs low in price, that it has the potential to skyrocket.  Bitcoin will take Litecoin on this ride because they are pretty much related. 

Plus, LTC took a huge dump earlier and people weren‚Äôt phased by it and kept investing."
505	What Is the Difference Between Litecoin and Bitcoin?	1628582124.0	58	"Well, with LTC my hair doesn't turn grey waiting for the first confirmation and I don't need to sell a kidney to pay for the miner's fees.
I actually read the article and I have issues with two points.

First LTC is not a ""fork"" of BTC. LTC's code is based off BTC but that does not make it a fork. Fork implies that they were once the same thing and split into two different things.

Secondly LTC is not a competitor to BTC. It was designed to work in tandem with BTC. That is where the silver and gold analogy comes in. No one thinks silver is a competitor to gold. Even Chalie Lee, LTC's creator has said you should hold 1 BTC before buying LTC.

If you try this be extremely careful.  Personally unless its a huge sum of money I would just chalk it up to a learning experience.  Keep in mind anyone PMing you offering to help is almost certainly trying to scam you. Scammers live for these posts.
Damn sorry this happened to you. This is definitely something in the crypto industry that needs to be fixed. There is no reason why anyone would purposely send LTC to a BTC wallet so there should be some tech that identifies the wallet type then blocks the transaction from ever happening if the wallet type does not match.
This is like the most common mistake and sort of one of the first things mentioned when transferring crypto. Double -triple check the address make sure it‚Äôs the right one.

>	Bitcoin is generally not considered to be a security by global regulators or to trigger the Howey test in the US. Bitcoin came into existence as mining began as an incentive mechanism in regulating the distributed platform at the point when the blockchain became functional. Importantly, there were no pre-mined coins sold to passive investors or retained for promoters or related entrepreneurs. The SEC chairman has said that it will not be considered a security. Others, such as the Israel Securities Authority, have said the same.

525	New to litecoin	1621702212.0	50	"Buy low sell high. Dont fomo life savings at ATH. Dont invest all your money life savings or even more than youre willing to lose instantly. Sub 100 is likely if you wanna wait till closer to bottom.

Be prepared to see your investment lose money long before it gains. Thats typically how buying the dip works so an investment strategy of some kind is recommended.

Like using the dips but investing incrementally as it trends down so all your eggs arent locked into one basket

If you actually care about crypto and blockchain technology though it is the future. Every single industry in modern society can benefit off the way blockchain stores and secures information. Practical applications go way beyond crypto so mass adoption is inevitable imo will just take time
Best place to start might be their website:  litecoin.org.

If people would use it 4x as much as Bitcoin the fees would be the same, in LTC. 

Which would still be less than the BTC fees, i don't see the price of 1 LTC getting to the price of 1 BTC :D

Good move, been holding for 4+ years. DCA'd during both bull and bear markets and won't be selling anytime soon. Litecoin is a sleeping giant.

I like the fact that it is respectable, stuck to its roots, does its own thing and gets along with BTC.  A pleasant future awaits indeed.
Yes I agree. BTC proof of work is very strong for value storage but LTC is better for daily uses

539	The best use case the Litecoin has is that it's cheaper and leaner than Bitcoin?	1612302486.0	51	"It's boring.  Boring is stable.  Crypto is a high risk investment.  A boring coin like Litecoin moves you to the lowest risk end of a high risk investment.  That's why it's in my portfolio - it might never take off, it may never go ""to the moon"" as the kids say, but it's always been a top ten coin, and likely always will be. Having a relatively safe investment in Litecoin gives you some wiggle room for some more speculative investments in other coins.
Try moving BTC around when the volume is super high. Especially during parabolic runs. You are gonna hate stuck transactions and exorbitant fees.

In the future, there will be much more people using BTC and it will cause even greater congestion, slower transaction time and higher fees. That‚Äôs when LTC shines. You hodl LTC until mass BTC adoption.
1) Usually pumps harder during parabolic bull markets.
2) Lower fee‚Äôs and faster to move (when Bitcoin‚Äôs network gets saturated, you‚Äôll see more people moving into Litecoin, which can also explain #1).
3) One of the coins to have survived the longest‚Äîa more secure long-term bet compared to other new pumpy coins due to an established history.
4) MWEB. It‚Äôll be the highest cap coin with the potential of hiding transaction amounts‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôll be the ideal method for whales to make transactions on the blockchain without third parties being able to analyze amounts.

I believe these people are in close-knit bubbles, with similar political beliefs, social media influence (i.e. they follow the same people, see the same shared posts), and introduced Litecoin to one another.

In my opinion these people don't represent the Litecoin community as a whole. They are just a vocal minority, who happen to be popular on Twitter or whatever.

**So what can we do?** Well, we can promote Litecoin too - there is no official face of Litecoin! Share less of these peoples posts & stop interacting with them.

Projects like Monero will still occupy a niche for extreme privacy, but I think Litecoin will take the title of mainstream privacy that's good enough for most people. Also looks like there are proposals for Grin like CoinSwap that will make it just as private as Monero with a few extra steps. We'll see what happens when it goes live, if the darknet markets and non-kyc exchanges start to use mweb we'll know it's a success.
I don‚Äôt know. Zcash also has an optional privacy feature but it‚Äôs rarely used for transactions. So transactions that do use it‚Äôs privacy protocol stick out like a sore thumb.

Secondly, use Reddit to affirm your thoughts. Do not use it to get advise but to confirm what you already know. Remember, you and I are the same, aside from our upbringing. 

Thirdly, look at why crypto is good. Look at the state of our economy, the way the world is moving, what people will value now, the history of the coin, future projects/development, partnerships, accessibility.... I could go on and on. 

Its wrong of me or anyone of us to tell you Litecoin is good or bad. We are individualistic by nature so we will lookout for ourselves first. We choose Litecoin and have our own reasons behind it. 

This probably isn't the answer you were seeking but I wanted to give a genuine response. 

And ALWAYS ask questions. This community is pretty solid and has a lot of good people in it.

I'm invested into Litecoin because the digital currency doesn't compete with Bitcoin's hashing power, Litecoin have a long history with no downtime, world wide adoption, functional as designed, store of value, and becoming sound money.

570	Will Tesla accept Litecoin?	1612949808.0	46	"Maybe. Maybe not.
Honestly, I don't see them *only* accepting BTC-it's just too expensive.   
Now, of course, this would be okay if they exclusively sold cars on [tesla.com](https://tesla.com). However, they sell a bunch of other shit as well. That leaves BCH and LTC. I'm assuming they won't want to deal with BCH (because of the lack of cohesion, but i'll still buy a little).   
Honestly, I don't know about the resistance etc TA shit, but to me, if Musk follows through on what he said (and I really, really believe he will), they will most definitely use LTC.   
Even if it was at its BTC ATH, i'd be crazy bullish on LTC. The fact that its at a fraction of that blows my fucking mind.   
If we see LTC being used at say, Starbucks, or to pay for Starlink in 3-4 years (and thats not even considering companies like Starbucks, etc doing so), I can easily see it at a 250-300B cap, making its value like 4k.

2. It‚Äôs been in the top 10 in terms of market cap since its beginning
3. A lot of payment infrastructure already exists for Litecoin due to its age. Therefore it has more use beyond just being pumped and dumped. Also the second most prevalent crypto in number of ATMs after Bitcoin
4. People are familiar with it and apps like Paypal support it which will give further exposure to it. It‚Äôs regarded as ‚Äúdigital silver‚Äù
5. Faster, cheaper transactions than Bitcoin while using Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals
6. Lots of good upcoming development like MimbleWimble integration
7. It‚Äôs got the backing of large institutional investors like Grayscale (not even Cardano has that)
8. Very good reputation, even better than Bitcoin and Ethereum in some regards. Litecoin‚Äôs network has never had any downtime despite concerns about network overload among some people. Furthermore, it doesn‚Äôt have a shady history like XRP. The worst thing that happened is the founder sold all his Litecoins
In my opinion Litecoin is best suited as a payments network. It's a digital currency which allows extremely quick (avg. 2.5m), low fee (< 1¬¢) and decentralised transactions. 

In comparison to Bitcoin, Litecoin is better suited to micropayments (everyday purchases), whilst Bitcoin might be 'safer' for buying a house.

When I say this, people react with: 'what about lightning network', 'what about abc-whatever-coin'. As Litecoin is extremely similar to Bitcoin, this allows it to be deeply connected to it. Newer technologies like Atomic Swaps allow users to instantly swap btc/ltc and submarine swap (onchain <-> offchain), this improves the Litecoin Lightning Network onboarding and allows users to automagically access the Bitcoin network. 

As Bitcoin fees continue to rise (currently $10-30 for a transaction), even the Bitcoin lightning network will be inaccessible for many. No one wants to spend that much money creating channels to users. This is one of the reasons why onboarding a new user to Bitcoin is bad. Litecoin very simply solves this, and complements Bitcoin.

I don't believe in digital silver, I don't think that's a thing. 2nd best at scarcity doesn't make any sense to me in the digital space.

I think the use case for ltc is fast transactions, and currently there are many projects looking to solve that problem. I don't see a clear winner here.

Ltc biggest strength to me is user base and brand. However, since this industry is fledgling at best, that could be wiped away in an instant.

I think that Litecoin is lacking **economic activity, like all other cryptocurrencies.** I think that we, members of the Litecoin society, should have a healthier strategy than the one that makes Bitcoin such a sickly (volatile) currency. In my humble opinion, **the less hype there is towards Litecoin, the healthier the currency will become**. What should drive the price up should be economic activity!

He makes a good point about PayPal and LTC. We saw similar action when it was listed on Coinbase. As accessibility expands and new investors come into crypto, a cheaper coin on the same tech will be very attractive. I think we can expect to make up some ground when that happens.
He's got one thing wrong, GBTC doesn't redeem shares ever. It's not like an etf where the etf creates and destroys shares (also called units) and buys and sells the underlying asset (bitcoins) to keep the market prices inline with the underlying asset. Once GBTC creates new shares they will always exist so in a crash GBTC could trade at a discount to Bitcoin."

In the context of it becoming a digital dollar tho it actually works in it's favor.  If it were to gain mass adoption (coinbase lists and stores keep accepting more), well it may become a symbiot and help push LTC up.  People are now  wanting to mine DOGE.  That will push them towards learning about LTC.

People that have a huge stash of litecoin that want to spend it easily. Unless they change their fees and benefits or even have an automated system to calculate taxes not much incentive vs other cards on the market.
I think the only people to really benefit are the OG OG Hodlers from when LTC was under a dollar.   
Having this card allows them to more **easily** buy hard goods; ( regular grocery shopping, bricks and mortar shop purchases with almost no restrictions etc )  
These people will have so much LTC that spending some via the card will hardly dent their wallet and future worth/profit."

Interesting to compare those two coins. As from a investment point of view it makes sense, from a technological point of view i does not: all they share is that they are coins, but both for different things.

I am positive that we will see an emerging market this week and i will have a closer look at the coins grayscale will buy. They bought a lot in the last week and might continue, due to the ridicolous premium of which a LTCN costs 2x a LTC.

629	Coinbase and wallets	1620295101.0	37	"You buy the coins on an exchange like coinbase, then you can transfer it to a wallet on your phone or computer.
You get hardware wallets (e.g Trezor) and software wallets. If using software a nice wallet I would recommend is Exodus. https://www.exodus.com/

Install it and it should give you the option to back it up. That will basically be 12 words which you need to keep safe. You will need these if you ever need to restore your wallet. If possible don't write then anywhere on your pc otherwise if you have a keylogger or malware your funds could be stolen. So write them on paper or somewhere safe. 

One you have the wallet installed you can do a small test transfer from coinbase to your wallet to see if you a comfortable with the process. Bitcoin and Eth fees will probably be quite high at the moment but if you're buying Litecoin it should be a lot less. 

Welcome to crypto and good luck.
If you use coinbase, use coinbase pro. Lower fees and more advanced functions. Set yourself up with some other exchanges like Gemini and Binance so you have redundant options incase one isn‚Äôt available. You buy on exchanges and send them to your own wallet.

A good free trustworthy wallet I‚Äôd recommend is [exodus](https://www.exodus.com/)"

With the IRS treating cryptos as investments, every single time a purchase is made using cryptos becomes sale of an investment, and one would have to track their gains or losses on each transaction. Each time one‚Äôs payroll check is converted to cryptos would be the purchase of an investment, requiring the documentation of initial purchase price, etc. It really is an interesting thought, but I think you risk (in the US at least) getting into very expensive and complex income tax issues if you‚Äôre constantly buying/selling cryptos on a daily basis unless there‚Äôs a significant piece of software tracking your purchases/sales and your daily gains & losses."

637	Cardano/Litecoin Fork Promises Multi-Chain Interoperability	1605887091.0	36	"I seriously hope the Litecoin community considers interoperability. And I say this without any financial ties to Cardano as I do not own ADA.

This entire space is heading towards Decentralized Exchanges. This allows Litecoin to be used peer to peer without having to move onto centralized exchange as those are not the future. 

The daily volume on Uniswap is already surpassing Coinbase. Trustless. Peer to peer. No KYC. Lightning Network is not the answer. It's a illusion with zero economic incentive, hence the zero economic activity using Lightning and more trustless value transfer using wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum.
This was settled on? It's definitely happening?

I had a question on using crypto for purchases. If you use crypto as currency to purchase goods. Do you not have to pay capital gains tax on the portion you spent on the transaction if you happen to gain value from the original purchase of the crypto. Example. Bought 1 coin for $100. Purchase bananas with crypto for  $50 but current value of coin is $150. I now have .5 coins still at coin value of $150. Do I pay capital gains tax on that .5 coin since the value rose 50% from time of purchase to time of sale for a purchase of goods?

Spoofing the spread. It is RAMPANT in crypto because there's no exchanges out there that have enough regulation to prevent that form of abuse.

Lots of exchanges don't even have a mechanism to verify that you're seeing arms length transactions. Who's to say Billy in Colorado isn't just buying his own crypto at a ridiculous price and just paying the transaction fee to manipulate the spread.

It's a big club, and you're not in it.

648	Litecoin as a daily payment method?	1600971920.0	34	"* You don't even need your laptop to use litecoin. Litecoin doesn't exist on your laptop, it exists within the blockchain. So, you can use a mobile wallet on your phone for easy portability. Hell, you could have a printed QR code and do litecoin transactions just by scanning that QR code if you really wanted (paper wallet). Of course, keep your main holdings in a 'cold' wallet, like on your home computer (or safely stored paper / hardware wallet). Just backup the private key somewhere safe. Hell, if you had the world's biggest brain, you could just memorize your private key and can do transactions without any kind of device (minus the device you'd use to broadcast the transaction from). Of course, don't attempt this, cause brains suck. But in theory you could do litecoin transactions this way lol.
* You can lose money on accident, but it has to be YOUR accident by sending LTC to a Bitcoin address that you don't control, or sending it to another Litecoin address you don't control, or losing your wallet and not having any backup. As long as LTC is in a wallet you control and have the private keys to, it's yours. Nobody can touch it. There's no such thing as a server exploit in blockchain (maybe in smart contracts on ETH, or chains still in development, but not LTC which is just a BTC clone). The only 'server exploit' is a 51% attack, where someone uses 51% or more of the entire Litecoin Network's computing power to make false transactions. But, this is stupidly expensive to do and can be undone once the attack finishes by rejecting the false chain (technical shit, not to worry about). This kind of attack usually targets large exchanges that have a lot of money and transactions, like Ethereum Classic recently had someone do this, where they sent ETC to an exchange during an attack, used that ETC to buy other crypto, then reversed the ETC transaction with their attack, thus stealing money from the exchange. Again, your funds are safe in this event, since the attacker and only reverse their own transactions (need keys to do anything with a wallet remember!), or prevent other transactions from getting confirmations (overwriting blockchain). They CAN NOT move anyone else's money that they don't have keys for.
* Sure, if someone has a litecoin wallet and accepts it, you can use it as payment. Or, you can go the route of say [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) and load your litecoin on their wallet (centralized, not your keys!) and use Crypto Pay to make payments by spending your litecoin and [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) handles the intermediary stuff (like if merchant wants dollars instead). There's many other payment gateways like this that will facilitate your crypto payment between you and a merchant, do some research see if there's popular ones in your country already.
* The only way Litecoin would not be usable, is if the entire internet globally just got destroyed. Even then, people have already sent Bitcoin transactions via RADIO and Satellite, and there is at least one Bitcoin node in space already today. Honestly, if the internet was to be crippled, cryptocurrencies would probably be one of the first online technologies to resurface due to it's decentralized nature. Even if the internet and all other means of conducting transactions just stopped existing, the Litecoin would still exist. You'd never lose it, you'd just lose access to it. As soon as there's a way to connect nodes to a network again, you can use your Litecoin again. Just to add to Crypto's immutability: Right now in China (which has some of the strictest currency laws), lots of people are using Crypto to move money out of China, which they couldn't do before - and China can't do anything about it due to the decentralized nature of crypto.
* In replacement of country's currency... Depends on your country. You might get prosecuted if they don't like it and you're under some military dictatorship. Depends on your local laws. And, depends how easy it is for you to conduct commerce in your country with Litecoin (again, via a payment gateway, or direct) and to on and offramp to your local fiat if necessary. Pretty sure Russia just made it illegal to do commerce with crypto, while also developing their own state crypto lol. You can still own crypto in Russia, but you best not get caught buying anything with it. If your country is still clueless about crypto and has no laws, then it's free game.
* It's decentralized. As long as you have a way to broadcast a transaction, and have your keys, Litecoin is always usable. If you lose your wallet / keys, you can no longer access your funds and nobody can recover it for you. You must control custody of your keys at all time, which is why you should back them up and save them somewhere safe. Even if your phone gets lost, stolen, broken and you had Litecoin on a mobile wallet -- as long as you had the private key backed up you can move those funds to a new wallet with new keys. Needless to say, NEVER give anyone your private keys cause then they can control your wallet and take your money.

Yes, you can carry it anywhere on a laptop, a smartphone, or pictures of your address QR in an old phone(Though this would only work for receiving).

If somebody accepts it, you can use it, there is a small blockchain fee on transactions(I sent 0.0005 ltc, fee was 0.0000008), and there isn't any problem on using it instead of Bs.

You don't need to be scared of it bein unusable, Bolivares have more chance of being unusable than litecoin.

And, as long as you have internet, yeah you can use it as you please."

652	I am very interested in getting into crypto and wanted to ask what‚Äôs the best way to buy lite coin? I‚Äôve seen previous posts that don‚Äôt recommend buying from PayPal. Where did everyone purchase theirs and how much did you put in at first?	1621819749.0	37	"If you‚Äôre in the US, Coinbase (and Coinbase Pro) are great! Gemini is also a great platform.

Edit: 

As others have mentioned, Coinbase Pro is where one would do their trading meanwhile Coinbase can net you some free coins after completing some short quizzes. 

Coinbase.com is also where one can stake any coins/tokens that can earn you interest.

Why Coinbase Pro? The Fee schedule is much lower when placing orders on that platform than on the regular coinbase site/app. 

Why Gemini? This one is a hot one. As a starting point, Gemini has a similar model to coinbase vs. coinbase pro. Meaning if you set your account to their ‚ÄúActiveTrader‚Äù setting, once logged in to Gemini‚Äôs exchange it will have a similar layout to Coinbase Pro and even a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù fee structure than Coinbase Pro if you‚Äôre average 30 day volumes remain under $9,999. Oh, they also give you one free withdrawal per mo & coin/token. It may have some limitations but if I can save on fees while HODLing, then save I will!

As an example your very first order, of the same amount of coin/token and of equivalent fiat cost across both sites and will have a fee of I believe 2.99 per order (coinbase) meanwhile on coinbase pro you may end up with a fee of 0.5% for the order.

Market cap is not an accurate measure of how much money is in a market. If you had the entire litecoin supply and sold it, you wouldn't receive the marketcap of litecoin. Because as you sold, the price would drop.

Whatever effect paypal's purchase had on marketcap is already reflected in the marketcap of the coin. For paypal, not increasing the marketcap of the coin when buying is ideal, because it means they obtained their coins at the current market rate without driving the price up

But nowadays LTC has an immense about of hash securing the blockchain, BTC has more for sure but you‚Äôd need an absolutely insane amount of computational power to compromise either network. And if you could afford that much power then you‚Äôd probably just use it to mine and secure your own investment. 

LTC is faster though and cheaper and in my opinion a little easier to use. You should check out LiteWallet, some of my friends and I use it as an alternative to venmo.
1. Bitcoin and Litecoin have the same medium-term risk of centralization, because the number of nodes is declining. This problem affects Litecoin more because it has fewer nodes. This is not yet a serious problem. If the node count eventually declines to less than 10, in a few countries, then law enforcement in those few countries can coordinate to shut down those remaining Litecoin nodes  

2. Queuing theory and orphan chain tips. Litecoin has a shorter block interval - 2.5 minutes vs Bitcoin's 10 minutes. The delay between blocks is an important part of the original Bitcoin design. It allows the node network enough time from block to block to stay synchronized. Bitcoin's longer delay is safer   

In normal times, a block arrives to a handful of nodes, gets verified, then propagated to another handful of nodes. The propagation rate is proportional to a logarithm of the number of nodes (very quick). In both networks, most blocks are fully propagated in less than 1 minute  

Occasionally, two miners win the mining race at the same time. Some nodes get one block. Some nodes get the other. When the next block, or the next 2 blocks arrive, some nodes recognize that they are out of sync, and do some calculations to determine which chain tip has ""more work"", then synchronize by dumping two or three blocks at the chain tip and replacing them  

Because Litecoin has a 75% shorter block interval, it is 4 times more likely to get orphan chain tips. Also, it has 7.5 minutes less time for nodes to resynchronize after one of these events. There is a potential race effect in the design, where the block interval could be too short for nodes to stay synchronized and the network can get stuck, permanently unable to catch up with itself. Bitcoin's 10 minutes could be far too long, too much headroom, excessively safe, or 10 minutes could be the Goldilocks block interval, just right. Queuing theory tells us that network congestion is non-linear, which makes a ""gridlock"" event unpredictable. Litecoin's 2.5 minute delay hasn't been a problem in 9 years, but could break at some unknown future level of transaction volume  

Urgh, too many words, I apologize  
Queuing a complicated thing, hard to explain  
The TLDR is that the 2.5 minute block interval may be too short, making Bitcoin safer  

Note than DOGE has a 1-minute block interval  

If there is no queuing gridlock problem, shorter block intervals mean faster transaction confirmation. And then DOGE wins the prize for best cryptocurrency

- is their anything new happening with LTC that could indicate upward or downward movement?

I believed all the hype back then - LTC is going to the moon, blah, blah, blah, only to fall victim to the pump and dump, and to watch my investment sink to over a 90% loss at a few points. Sure, I should have averaged down, but I became unable to buy more due to money issues and just being poor for a while. To be honest, I'll probably offload these soon because I stressed over these for 3+ years, and I just want out haha. I do think that in the long run, these will be worth more, but given that both BTC and Ethereum both surpassed their peaks back in 2017, and LTC still has not, I don't know that LTC will ever be as big as either of them.
I bought several at their peak, but then it was down at ¬£20 GBP per LTC in 2018 and bought a load then, so well in the green.

I was never ever going to sell at a loss, you shouldn't either dude!

The more hash power, the more secure the chain becomes. But more hash power will raise the difficulty. Which in turn lowers miner's profitability.

694	Buy stuff with litecoin ?	1613489903.0	31	"It's never a guarantee that any cryptocurrency will keep growing in value. It's easy to say that now in a bull market, but it certainly didn't feel that way pretty much all throughout 2018.

Also, transactions using cryptocurrency can be a more convenient and cheaper transfer of value for both the buyer and vendor because it doesn't require banks, payment platforms or credit card companies, as well as the fees that come with using such products.
Most will give discounts if you use crypto. To most ""I want it now"" Americans, a discount is better than future gains.
Other reason for paying with crypto is to help the network develop by using it. As long you buy with your fiat the crypto back you used to pay for something, it counts twice. One transaction for the network by paying and another one for adding again to your wallet. That are 2 transactions on the network, that else didn't happen and didn't add value to the network. The more crypto is used in the day to day life, the more the intrinsik value grows and probably also the value VS fiat."

696	The silver to Bitcoins gold	1611175441.0	30	"Biden‚Äôs new SEC chair will partially be in charge of regulating crypto.  Luckily he teaches courses about crypto at MIT.

Here is what his book had to say:


>	Bitcoin is generally not considered to be a security by global regulators or to trigger the Howey test in the US. Bitcoin came into existence as mining began as an incentive mechanism in regulating the distributed platform at the point when the blockchain became functional. Importantly, there were no pre-mined coins sold to passive investors or retained for promoters or related entrepreneurs. The SEC chairman has said that it will not be considered a security. Others, such as the Israel Securities Authority, have said the same.

>For the same reasons, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, both forks off from Bitcoin in 2011 and 2017, respectively, also do not appear to trigger the US Howey test.

>	Thus, regardless of whether the ETH sale in 2014 may have passed the Howey test, the SEC has said that it is now sufficiently decentralised not to be considered an investment contract.

There you have it, the four cryptos that the new top regulator considers to be legal. 

This is probably why PayPal and other large investors are focusing on these cryptos above all others.

As for the rest, namely tokens:
>	This leaves XRP and EOS, which might each have been investment contracts, or non-compliant securities offerings, when sold. Whether XRP, EOS and others are non-compliant securities under US law will be determined by the SEC and US courts. Regardless, though, purchasers of these tokens have borne investment risk in anticipation of appreciation based upon the entrepreneurial efforts of others ‚Äì precisely the types of economic risks that underlie global investor protection frameworks.

Seems like XRP type coins will force big regulations on to the crypto market but BTC/ETH/BCH/LTC will be the coins immediately deemed ‚Äúgood to go‚Äù.

\- No Fiat Support, would like to have direct deposits from my paycheck etc to load up the card.

\- No cashback rewards, no benefits to really use, also minimum amount of spending required in a month to not pay the monthly fee.

Honestly it's a start, the card looks clean and nice looking at it.  But no point in really using it, I only see the benefits for earlier users that have a ton of LTC that want to spend it without directly having to convert it to usd to their bank account.  I am guessing this is a start just to get it out there but they need to improve or you will have a very small userbase.

With existing cards like crypto dot com or even the new coinbase card what does this card do and what purpose does it serve vs the other crypto cards.
I still haven't received mine.
Don't have one, don't see the point. It seems like an entirely unnecessary layer of abstraction.  Litecoin card is trying to emulate the very thing that Litecoin is here to replace. It'd be like Henry Ford slapping some mechanical legs on his early vehicles to help navigate dirt roads."

No, Litecoin is better positioned to be a digital currency that people actually use day to day because of its speed and low fees, where Bitcoin has become more a store of value that people hold onto long term.
I believe that down the road, Litecoin will reach as high as 10% of the Bitcoin. I don‚Äôt mind this since LTC is $200 and BTC is $57k. 

Here‚Äôs my prediction, every time BTC doubles in value, so does LTC. If and when people decide to heavily invest (long term) in LTC, you will see a near instant jump of $10k at a minimum. Then we will hold it and it will grow drastically at that point."

The duration of the first quest is indeed just 1 block, but this isn't a typical gameplay later on. The players have to micro-manage quite a bit in the beginning, but my guess is that this is done primarily to let them become more familiar with the game mechanics and try various things. Later this becomes a non-issue.

Also the blog author suggests to use just one hero. But my understanding is that actually having multiple heroes may be preferred, simply because they serve different roles.

And it's possible to play the game even without any heroes! The in-game market is available to everyone and people can try to make money simply by buying resources/equipment there and then reselling this stuff for a higher price.

I already mentioned that this is an ""idle game"", so it may be not everyone's cup of tea. But it is actually pretty entertaining for those who like this particular genre. I tried it out of curiosity with low expectations, but then got hooked up.
Since you play and nobody else has commented on it yet, I'll ask you. Do you make LTC playing, spend LTC playing, or break even?"

if they are taking the RH model (which most likely are)

they buy the coin --- you rent it

LTC is not a privacy coin, I believe there are only 3 coins driven towards complete privacy. I generally hold LTC and XMR so this is just my curiosity. Cheers
All the coins seem to be in early development but he spoke about the ""ecash"" being widely used. Having a fast coin with low transaction fees and then adding a sense of privacy can go a long way. It's a race to which coin is going to be on top and no one knows. The only way to see how it works is in practice which is coming fairly soon for litecoin. I am still studying cryptocurrency so that is why I said possibly. Great mention though, a good start for discussion.
That is where I get curious, as XMR is cheaper in fees, faster in transaction and more private than LTC. Again, I am not trying to talk down on LTC. I love the coin and Charlie Lee, but in terms of facts, can he be speaking about LTC when it doesn‚Äôt fit any of the characteristics mentioned?"
749	Hi Everyone!	1613433583.0	26	"Probable?  LTC is ten years old. We use it often because it‚Äôs so cheap to move and it much quicker than BTC.  Many merchants that accept BTC but they also accept LTC.  Welcome!
You should try using it. Get Litewallet, load up some funds and go order something online. I usually use mine to pay for my VPN  and to donate websites that I like. Sometimes I make online purchases but I‚Äôve been in an accumulation stage so that has cooled off a little.

LTC is one of the oldest and most revered coins out there, the network has never gone down, regulators have never doubted its legitimacy, the founder still works on the project full time and institutions like PayPal (as you know) think it‚Äôs one of the few cryptos (out of thousands) worth getting in bed with. 

You should really take it for a spin and see why the greater crypto and investment community has so much faith in LTC. It‚Äôs really very convenient, much more so than BTC imo.

If you can PM me information about the person who has been making these comments to you, and your username I can investigate this for you.
Sounds like you're better off without them.
If you still want an answer to your question. There are many reasons.

1) Blockchain security : very few coins have a blockchain that has as much processing power securing it. It‚Äôs very easy to make a coin that has near zero fees especially if it‚Äôs a new or widely unused coin it‚Äôs much more difficult to secure a blockchain.

2) Low fees: While there might be fees, they‚Äôre incredibly low...even now.  I think the last major transaction I had was less than a penny in fees.  It‚Äôs the exchange service fees that cost me the most and those are mostly uniform for all coins.

3) Lightning network: once this is widely used your fee concerns will become even less relevant. And any coins not on the lightning network will also become less relevant. This is the future of crypto.

4) Popularity: lite coin is in the top five of mineable coins for daily transacted volume and also market-cap (less important). If you want to use decentralized crypto then your best bets at having it accepted somewhere are BTC, ETH and LTC. And again this goes back to network security, vendors don‚Äôt want to accept crypto that isn‚Äôt more or less immune to gigantic persistent attacks. These are the safest coins right now. 

5) Longevity: LTC has been around forever and now it has more or less cemented itself as a test bed for Bitcoin. I think it‚Äôd be very unlikely for LTC to fail at this point unless bitcoin also failed.  I don‚Äôt think it will be nearly as successful in terms of price or market cap, but I do think that it has a bright future ahead of it. In short it has benefited from first mover advantage."

The ‚Äútest ground‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, LTC functions independently. I see Litecoin as further decentralization for BTC. A second chain, benefiting from the same development, with a different mining algo so it can‚Äôt be attacked by BTC miners. The faster confirmations and higher capacity is the cherry on top. With the goal of decentralization, BTC and LTC go together well.

At this point, no one is using BTC for payments because on-chain fees are too high, so it‚Äôs LTC‚Äôs time to shine.
I am not an expert. As far as I know there is a chance that companies like Paypal, Visa will be listing Litecoin as valuta in the future.

763	Why Bitcoin instead of Litecoin	1611800210.0	24	"I buy both end of story.  I think both will be with us forever
Fist mover advantage, higher network security.

The scarcity of a coin is an ""illusion"" since a unit can be arbitrarily divided (at the moment to 10 d.p. aka 1 satoshi). What you are paying for is fractional ownership of the network whose worth is a function of the security that secures that network.

If you are moving small amounts of money, you can use a lesser secured network. If you are moving large assets, you will choose a more secure network. LTC is fine for daily transactions and most peoples savings.
I like Litecoin when it's at a low ratio to Bitcoin like now. Also great that it's an honest coin that plays a testnet role for papa bear. Always thought it should be more like 10x higher vs btc than it is now but the market decides."

Hi.. Thanks for doing this, man.

I   also have assets in their system that are stuck  in their exchange and   in need of withdrawal. Needless to say, I emailed them. Two days, no   response yet.

What amazes me the   most is that I have had numerous emails back and forth in the past with   OpenLedger support, so they had my email in their contacts/data...   Yet,  they didn't want to email me \[the client\] about this. So I'm  pretty  sure they didn't want to notify anyone about their shutdown.

Also,   From what I can see, BitShares and everyone in this project definitely   share the responsibility for this. BitShares claims decentralized   systems, and they have had OL as their default DEX for a long long time.   What kind of DEX closes shop and runs off with everyone's trusted   assets?? Bitshares and OL are both two faces of one coin.

Will   definitely join you on this and do my best to help. Would also   definitely fight for my crypto assets and do my best to sue Ronny   Boesing \[CEO\] and whoever in charge of this mockery show. \[I've already   sent you an email\]

Hopefully we gather some members and file for a serious law suite or something.

This needs exposure to the crypto space. If let such things slide by  without  a real response the cryptocurrency will never mature.

Of course Bitcoin will need to think of a new narrative, but they have successfully done that in the past(digital Gold) (SOV) all that BS.....

Bitcoin will be traceable and that is what governments will want.....and Bitcoin community will be happy with that if it makes them FIAT Rich.....

Noobs look so shortsightedly and only see 1 path and don‚Äôt understand there are many and you bet on some.
Bitcoins‚Äôs mega dangerously variable weakness is the fact that the creator is an unverifiable-unknown.

Litecoin on the other hand has an ultra-transparent, founding and creators are known and have demonstrated honesty at extreme levels.
True, in regards to the unknown creator, Litecoin‚Äôs creator (Charlie Lee) is known, he‚Äôs a computer scientist, has worked for google and coin base which gives me him more credibility. 

Also, lite coin I believe has a cap of 83 million, which isn‚Äôt too far from Bitcoin‚Äôs supply of 21 million. If in the case of a crypto-tide shift.

Your price range doesn't actually affect what coin you can buy. You can buy any amount of each coin down to some super small decimal place (e.g. you can buy .0001 LTC if you want).

I like LTC, as it transacts quickly and is generally the most useful currency for quick payments IMO.

I also really like ETH because it's just on a whole different level in terms of potential usefulness in the future. If you are curious, Google devcon1 eth and watch Vitalik talk about ethereum.
If you're are interested in buying ltc, now is a good time to buy. Yesterday and tomorrow were/will be decent options also.

The main thing to know is that the price could drop significantly in the short term. Only buy an amount you are prepared to lose in its entirety. This is important because if you buy more than this you will probably sell when the price drops (which it will).

The only people that make money hold long enough for the price to significantly rise. This may take years fyi."

793	The Case for Litecoin (Discussion)	1613233971.0	23	"rambling, but a few other FUD notions that initially concerned me + my thoughts

1. Government intervention - Banning cryptos implicitly makes the argument that cryptos are effective. If that‚Äôs truly the case, banning cryptos will transfer that opportunity for more wealth (from taxes, etc) to other places where it isn‚Äôt banned. LTC in particular is much less likely to be viewed as a security because it never burned assets, did giveaways, etc
2. Litecoin is dead - we see things being worked on as we speak with MW
3. Other coins do things better than LTC - While that‚Äôs true, i don‚Äôt see one that occupies the space that bitcoin does. So as an example, Stellar is a quicker, cheaper way to send money, but btc to ltc just makes more sense assuming you‚Äôre going from btc (the primary store of value). With that being said, i do see stellar and other coins coexisting
4. bitcoin doesn‚Äôt need ltc - At the end of the day, if bitcoin truly does become larger and globally accepted, there are ONLY 21M coins at MOST. If btc becomes a store of value, the point of it almost becomes NOT to spend it. in that case, LTC seems like the perfect next coin to use. We‚Äôre already seeing this now with LTC having more volume than it‚Äôs market cap

Mark my words. In 5 years we will have plenty of those full-service digital exchanges as the crypto space won't stop growing.  


This year, 2021 is the year of huge adoption. Imagine the volume we will get once the people start pouring down space. You can run a node on a DEX and take the trading fees if you want.

804	Will MWEB make these charts obsolete?	1616640654.0	22	"I think it ultimately depends on the exchanges. As we all know, they are governed by the AML/KYC regulations, which is why privacy coins are a NO-GO for them. We also all know that the LTC Devs worked with the exchanges to make sure that they were okay with this update and that LTC wouldn‚Äôt get delisted as a result of it. 

The opt-in/opt-out portion is why exchanges are okay with this update. MWEB is a side chain and exchanges don‚Äôt have to participate in or support the side chain. 

However, nobody has stated whether a coin that has been through a MWEB transaction (that is, it is no-longer in an extension block/it is back on the main chain) will be accepted for transfer to an exchange.

If the exchanges refuse to accept coins that have been through a MWEB transaction or ‚Äúfungified‚Äù (or whatever we end up calling it), then MWEB is useless for most of us. And nobody will use it because nobody wants to lose access to a fiat off-ramp. In that case, this chart will still be a thing.

If exchanges DGAF that a specific coin has been used in a MWEB transaction or not, then yes, I‚Äôd say this chart will become obsolete.
Maybe, maybe not. I guess a good way of interpreting MWEB is looking Zcash with it‚Äôs also opt-in privacy. Zcash is *marketed as a privacy coin* but over 99% of it‚Äôs transactions are public. I don‚Äôt know the details of MWEB so someone clarify if I‚Äôm wrong.
No you seem to think mweb is a core implementation protocol when it's an overlay

It may be a bit less useful as a speculative metric seeing as future distribution will be skewed by people choosing to transact on mweb but that doesn't change the fact preexisting wallets and balances are already known"
805	ELI5: What is MimbleWimble and what makes it so good?	1616577507.0	22	"MW gives privacy. Privacy means, 3rd parties are not able to see who you are sending to or how much you are sending.

An associated benefit is that in MW you can permanently forget some intermediate transaction data. Which ... saves space
Fungibility.  

Every dollar in your pocket is the same as every other dollar, currently with BTC and LTC this is not the case with your coins.  Each coin has a history and that history may taint that coin.

MWEB adds fungibility, and fungibility is a key aspect of any sound currency
So my question is what will MW or how will MW affect those of us who are mining LTC? Will it just increase difficulty?"

I‚Äôve been using BlockFi for about 3 months now, stuck all my idle crypto in there to earn something. I‚Äôve made more money on interest in those 3 months than 3 years of interest from my bank. 

BlockFi has been around since 2017 (I think), I believe it‚Äôs less risky than these newer lending sites.

Keep in mind the following, only invest the money that you can lose.
Regards Alex
Dear friend. Firstly let me welcome you to the world where you age 4x faster than normal humans do.  Secondly let me tell you about my experience. Revolut is not bad, if you only want hold your coins for months/years and than cash out at a price of your choosing it is A--OK. But you need to understand that on Revolut or Robinhood (EU uses Revolut since no access to RH, and since GME fiasco RH is a bye bye) - owning crypto , is almost the same as owning a share/stock. Sadly you can't transfer it out on wallets or use it in any other way. For me it is fine, I just want to hodl it. For beginners this is safe and not to complicated + your investments on Revolut are insured so if anything happens 100k USD- is insured. Revolut is the middle man in this case, it is like he holds your crypto for you, but it never gives it to you to ""hold"" it in your own hand. 

**1.What to watch out for**: Please if you plan on selling, or buying more crypto, purchase the premium subscription, since than your fee will be only 1.5% (not 3%) do the math. It is worth it ! Believe me mate when I tell you I tried almost all crypto platforms/wallets what revolut offers for this price is acceptable. (You can even send crypto to your revolut friends for quite some time now, try it it's fun) 

**2.** **The negative**: The coin is not actually yours. 1.5% fee is still high-ish but if you will try more crypto trading sites you will see everyone has a pretty steep fee charges, wrapped in a landslide of complicated sentences and BS explanations. Lastly on revolut there are only a few coins available, I think they will probably put in more in Q2 of this year.

3.**The good**: Nobody will hack you , or you won't lose your wallet keys + You can send crypto to your friends. Hard to mess up, good for starting or get the feel how crypto moves, learn what the feeling of FOMO or FUD actually mean. You will learn that you'll see. And that lesson won't be free.

**4.After you are a bit more sure what you do**:  Myself , I tried what I could. Stay clear from [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) (they offer the biggest selection btw but stay clear) & E-toro. I would recomend 2 wallets/platforms to trade on.  

a.) [blockchain.com](https://blockchain.com) \- so user friendly it makes me shed a tear almost, and you do get a wallet and it is down to earth. - you only get a few coins to chose from but the main stablecoins are there sadly litecoin is not, this is the ONLY reason I don't use them. 

b.) if you want to play with the big boys go BINANCE - they have almost to non 0 fees and you can find pretty much every coin there. The downside is that it is not so user friendly. Same here you get wallet in app or you can transfer your coins bought on Binance to another wallet of your choosing + you can deposit your crypto and it will bring revenue monthly or yearly . On Binance please go slow and steady, don't go into Margins and shit like that ... ""Not everything is gold what has a shine to it""

&#x200B;

Good Luck (if you have any questions feel free, I will try to answer it by my best knowledge)

810	Buying LTC through Lite Wallet	1613540474.0	23	"Yes.. there are fees, but obviously, the cost is upfront and it is the only  way Litecoin Foundation is raising any significant revenue with Litewallet. There are no extra fees to send / receive.

So, for the convenience of buying LTC **within 5 mins**, our partner charges a fee and the foundation gets some of that revenue.  The alternative is no option for some countries and a 2 -3 week time to get a crypto exchange setup.

We are in alpha testing to add more partners. So, you will have options. As always, please store and protect your 12 words!

815	Litecoin volume	1610232632.0	22	"LTC's biggest strengths is its speed and cheap cost...The high volume is because its the easiest way to move
Coinmarketcap volume is the trading volume of LTC pairs on exchanges. Lots of algorthmic trading happens on exchanges, and can be higher than the market cap itself.

Bitinfocharts sent value is the amount sent on-chain from wallet to wallet. We have a lot of space for this to increase, but it‚Äôs likely to be lower than trading volume on exchanges. These on-chain transactions are what cryptocurrency was made for in the first place. BTC and ETH cost like $5-$10 to send a transaction on chain now, while LTC still costs a few cents at most.

Was 'working' on an iOS app, with no pay for a couple of months. The company lost their primary source of revenue, and the business just fizzled away. I had a pretty powerful computer (2x 5970 graphics cards) and was looking to make any money possible. Even thought about renting out Minecraft servers, though my home internet connection just wouldn't be good enough. After a while of searching, and I found Bitcoin.

Still remember it now. It was late 2012/early 2013, I downloaded Bitcoin Core on my MacBook, and started to let the client sync, whilst I did more research at 2am. After realising that it would be impossible to make money without a bitcoin FPGA/rumoured ASICs, I then searched for bitcoin alternatives. On the bitcoin wiki I found Litecoin!

At first I interacted only on bitcointalk and litecointalk, but later here on /r/Litecoin.

the rest is history as people say...
My very first investment, even before my 401k at 21. I saw the price of bitcoin which was like $3,000 something, saw the price of LTC which was like $20 something and decided to go with LTC because I can afford it and maybe it‚Äôll be the same price as bitcoin sometime soon.

From then on I learned a lot, mostly about bogdanoff and sminem influence on the market.
In 2017 my Daughter told me her friends Dad bought her a house after graduation and will do same for 6 other daughters.. I was like wow I know him, how is he affording that? Oh he bought Bitcoin years ago!  So I learned quickly via YouTube and my first coin was LTC and remained my favorite ever since..üëçüëçüöÄüöÄüöÄ"

I'd wait a few years, maybe 5 or 10 until it levels off, 72% drops in prices is ""normal"" in this market, LTC just experienced a 14% drop, obviously it wigged you out, definitely get out now, this market is about to see MUCH more volatility over the next 18 months, it does not make you a pussy or anything, but crypto is DEFINITELY not for the person who worries about HUGE swings, most people cannot handle it and get reckt buying high and panic selling low. Get out now.

I think once we start actually using crypto litecoin is going to be one of the main cryptos used instead of cash.  It's basically bitcoin but faster the way I see it.  Bitcoin is most secure but litecoin is so much faster.

No one is going to want to wait 20 mins for a bitcoin transaction,  litecoin is waaaayy faster.  I still get freaked out transferring bitcoin when it takes longer than 20 minutes.  Litecoin shows up super quick.  If your out buying shit at the store no one is going to want to wait even 5 minutes for their crypto transaction to go through.

We might still have a lot of time for crypto to get adopted but maybe not.  The banks are collapsing now.  Hence the reason they have to print trillions of dollars to keep economy from imploding on itself.

The crypto community now is still a bunch of tech nerds hyper focused on the best tech.  They are unconnected with the real world.  People don't know jack shit about tech and don't give a fuck honestly.  They just want what everyone else is doing. They'll see it in the top 10 and jump on it.   And litecoin is actually known to the sheeple and is still cheap as fuck compared to bitcoin. It's very undervalued in my opinion.
Litecoin, just like BTC, has real adoption. Looking at the ""big picture"", Bitcoin is the only blockchain that I feel has gone beyond a proof of concept. Time has no mercy, and Bitcoin has stood the test of time. Now big adoption is coming. Litecoin has a good chance to fulfill its role as a digital silver.

873	I have some questions about litecoins technical features...	1621742308.0	17	"> Is that 4 fold time reduction (10 mins to 2.5 mins) related to the 4 fold increase in capped supply of litecoins (21 mill to 84 million)?

The blocks are 4 times more frequent than Bitcoin. Bitcoin's halving interval is 210000 blocks, approximately 4 years. Litecoin's halving interval is 840000 blocks, approximately 4 years  

The supply total is a simple arithmetic consequence of  

*    the initial reward amount  
*    the number of blocks in each halving period  
*    the sum of halves is a geometric series which equals 1  

Total supply ...  

    Bitcoin:  50 * 210000 * (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...) = 21000000  
    Litecoin: 50 * 840000 * (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...) = 84000000

> Is there some technical, mathematical or programming reason for it? Or some other reason?

To have the same supply schedule as Bitcoin, halving approximately every 4 years

> What effect does litecoins different hashing algorithm have?

scrypt was chosen with the belief that an algorithm with a heavy memory requirement would not be economically viable to make an ASIC. Bitmain made an ASIC anyway. Ironically, Bitmain has since abandoned scrypt ASICs. But Litecoin is still ASIC-only  
https://www.asicminervalue.com/efficiency/scrypt

> Does the pow difficulty level adjust every 2 weeks just like bitcoin?

Yes, every 8064 blocks

> If the various features of Litecoin have solved some of bitcoins scalability problems (faster transaction times and cheaper fees)

First, to debunk the myths ...  

Bitcoin's 10-minute block interval isn't a scaling problem. Litecoin has cheaper fees because its blocks are never full and anybody can have next-block confirmation with a minimum fee rate, 1 Sat/vbyte. When Bitcoin's blocks were mostly not full, as recently as 10 months ago, minimum fee transactions would confirm in the next block. Bitcoin fee, 144 Satoshis. Litecoin fee, 144 Litoshis

> what disadvantages does this create? i.e. what are the tradeoffs to achieve this?

It is possible that Litecoin's block interval is too short. In future, when it gets busier, its node network could become stalled. See another discussion  
https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/nfyxvo/why_does_it_take_specifically_around_10_mins_to/gyozwzf/  

> Do you agree with the trilemma that you can only have 2 out of the 3 features ‚Äì security, decentralisation and scalability?

I agree that all cheap slogans are bullshit  

Bitcoin's transaction capacity limit is discussed here  
https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ix46wm/why_does_bitcoin_allow_only_4_transactions_per/g64q1ph/  

The flaw in most scaling discussions (and the cheap slogans) is to see this limit as a problem which needs a solution. It isn't a problem. The ""solution"" to this non-problem is for the community to recognize when Bitcoin is close to its known limit, and then spread the transaction load to another, similar cryptocurrency  

Bitcoin has hit the limit early, because it is bloated by speculators' useless transactions. When the speculation bubble bursts, Bitcoin's real-world use will remain, about 60k transactions per day, well under its capacity  

As more use cases slowly appear, in 5 to 10 years, Bitcoin will approach its limit of about 600k transactions per day. Then, to avoid overfull mempools, delayed transaction confirmation, and high fees, users can choose to spread their transactions between Litecoin and Bitcoin  

Ten to 20 years after this, Litecoin reaches its limit. Maybe we will discover that the 2.5 minute block interval is too short. Otherwise, Litecoin's limit is about 2.4 million transactions per day. If Dogecoin is still alive, it gives the world another 20 years of growth  

There is no scaling problem
guys, what do you think, will Catz coin pump this year? perfect chance to join it?
Hey thanks sooo much for your comment, it‚Äôs really informative. 

But if scalability isn‚Äôt a problem why would they develop the lightning network for btc? 

And when you say the solution to the non-problem is the community should spread the load to another currency, by the community you mean users? Everyone just has stock of different currencies in their wallets and will be incentivised to use ltc or doge if the btc network is congested, because congestion means fees are high and confirmation times slow? This sounds like scalability is solved by expanding the number of currencies.

When you say use cases in 5-10 years, do you envision bitcoin etc becoming a currency we use for day to day purchases? Or more like a digital cash we use alongside digital fiat, only in particular use cases like ‚Äúavoiding the censorship of payment processors‚Äù?Kind of the same way we have paper cash now which we use for that purpose?"

881	What is the difference between bitcoin cash and litecoin?	1613412050.0	20	"Litecoin is much more secure (less prone to being 51% attacked) due to dominating its mining algorithm (Scrypt).

Litecoin also has SegWit implemented (BCash is against SegWit), permitting Litecoin to have second layer scaling solutions such as Lightning Network built on top of it, following Bitcoin‚Äôs path. 

Also, purely my opinion, but Litecoin has much more integrity- BCash community is known for trying to scam people into thinking it‚Äôs the real Bitcoin.
Litecoin was created as a code fork of BTC.

The mining algorithm was changed to Scrypt as some members of the community thought ASICs posed a future problem to the security of the coin. Scrypt now has Asic implementations as well so that particular feature is no longer relevant. With that being said, LTC is the top coin on Scrypt so the transactions are quite secure.

It also reduced the blocktime parameter to 2.5 min per block to allow for faster confirmations.

LTC has also implemented most BTC upgrades as well so it currently supports 4x the throughput of BTC.

BCH was created as a chain-fork of BTC so it uses the same (Sha256) hash algorithm.

It was created because a rift happened in the BTC community with some posing that the blocksize must be increased while others posed that increasing the blocksize was dangerous.

The differences could not be reconciled so BCH split from BTC in 2017 with a base blocksize 8x that of BTC. That was later turned into a soft-cap so miners can set their own maximum mined and accepted block size.

That way the people who run the hardware that secure the network can determine and come to a consensus on block size.

The current on-chain capacity of BCH is around 25x that of BTC (as miners are generally using a 32MB blocksize while SegWit allows for some additional capacity on BTC that BCH does not have)

I‚Äôm so sick of people not understanding why he sold his ltc. I‚Äôm bored of people asking him again and again why he sold in interviews.....

*he said he was moving the market with his tweets. It made him look like he was pumping his own bags. (Not a good look) so he sold.

*bitcoin has a million coins locked up in a wallet by satoshi. What country would ever use it as there currency with 5% hanging in limbo? What country would move there GDP to a currency made by a unknown person or organisation?

Charlie stepping down was giving ltc to the world. 

Ltc is the world currency now. Like gold or silver. We can do with it as we wish. Hopefully for good and positive change üíôüß°

So, the perfect answer is, it‚Äôs money. Not all crypto is backed by Bitcoin because it‚Äôs gold. Thinking of it that way is just creating a new form of what we have already, (or used to have, as the dollar is not backed by gold anymore.) No, each is a coin or token to spent on goods and services. Anonymous and free from government regulation, and not able to be controlled or centralized. That said, I appreciate this sub much more than the r/Bitcoin, they‚Äôre mostly traders now and mock old cypherpunk ideals. Bitcoin is nice, it‚Äôs the OG, but, a lot of it is already owned by billionaires and mined mostly in massive operations in China. Litecoin is what Bitcoin was meant to be. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.
I like to think of Litecoin as a decentralized system of transferring value between peers, secured by consensus-based PoW hashing algorithms and some valued backed by a fixed supply. Will it ever be used as an everyday currency for all kinds of purchases? Hard to say, but I do see it maintaining use as a way to transfer large sums of value/money outside of centralized mechanisms.

This question comes my way quite often (since I work on Litecoin), so here's an mock conversation:

> What's Litecoin?

Litecoin is a digital money. You might've heard about Bitcoin, it's kinda similar to that.

> What's the difference between regular money and Litecoin?

Litecoin can be sent almost instantly, across the world. Fees are extremely low to the point it can often be considered non-existent.

> How does it work?

People describe Litecoin as decentralised. That means that there's no company that runs Litecoin, nor is there a central server that can be hacked.

> err, how does that work then?

It uses a technology called Blockchain. It's kinda like a database of every transaction which every single person has a copy of. When someone creates a new transaction, everyone's computer automatically adds a copy of it to their copy of the Blockchain.

> since it's like a computer thing, why can't I copy/paste new litecoin

2. Bitcoin bears would talk a LOT about the huge transaction fees (hence why btrash was born) and litecoin was literally a few pennies to transact.

3. Litecoin had a lot of buzz for starting tests on the lightning network to solve the scaling issues of bitcoin. It already acted as a test ground for segwit before bitcoin a few months prior to that.

Get started with Coinbase, they have an app as well as a separate wallet. The app allows you to easily buy and sell while still being able to transfer to other wallets. Very user friendly,stay away from Apps like Robinhood where you do not actually own your coins. 
Good luck
I highly recommend that after you purchase your LTC, you download the Litewallet app (developed by the Litecoin foundation) to store your Litecoins.

What I learned is if it's online it's at risk. My LTC  was behind at least 3 security hurdles but I suspect a reused password was the last weakness that allowed them to take it. 

My advice. Stand back up and learn from this. I still VERY much believe in crypto, but when you're an early adopter(which I think we all still are) you are going to the school of hard knocks.

909	Protecting users from themselves	1610715952.0	18	"I believe that Litecoin wallets (like Bitcoin) use a checksum system to confirm that the address is valid. If you mistype one or a few characters in an address your wallet probably won‚Äôt allow you to make the transfer. The only realistic way to send funds to the wrong address is if you copy the wrong address and don‚Äôt double check that it is the right one.
There are other problems that users face, such as:  


Losing the private key, and being unable to move their funds anymore  
Leaking the private key, and letting malicious actors drain all funds from the account.  


I have ideas for other blockchains that have **basic services that traditional banks have but cryptocurrencies lack**. However, it seems that the crypto environment is being flooded by scams and buzzwords, and no developer seems to be interested in tacking problems that common users face.  


The amount of hype disappoints me, and I'm trying to find sober people that do want to do a project that accomplishes the original intent of the Bitcoin whitepaper (that has been widely disregarded and forgotten). SegWit, widely implemented in Litecoin, is a step in the right direction, but we need much more steps in order to reach the original goal.
> basic services that traditional banks have but cryptocurrencies lack

Cryptocurrency is not a bank account. It is analogous to cash in your pocket. Hand-holding and spoon-feeding negligent users only leads to different errors, more and more complicated software and unreliable software

> the original intent of the Bitcoin whitepaper (that has been widely disregarded and forgotten)

A lot of people use words like this. Most of them are not honest. Where does the white paper say the software has to protect users from losing their keys?  

As for your suggestion about payment orders  
Your rationale is that users should be protected from sending to a bad address, and a payment order is better than an address because it can be encoded as a QR. An address can be encoded as a QR. A clipboard trojan can forge a signed payment order. I suggest you're working in the wrong problem space

The best part is: Whale Alert will likely **never** say that a whale moved some LTC, because once confidential transactions are implemented, it simply won't be possible to see if huge amounts of money are being moved.

Litecoin has a max of 84 million with @ 66 million in circulation,  that leaves 18 million more to go. I think as bitcoin becomes higher priced alot of those investor's will see litecoin in the same manner and start accumulation of it. Buy a whole Litecoin rather then a .00075 of Bitcoin.

Good luck! Buying and holding is the best strategy! And LTC is a great place to to apply this strategy!üëç
Good idea to buy and hold.

Also I believe this is a good time to get LTC if you haven't already.

You can download latest litecoin core wallet for PC and sync the litecoin block chain to latest. The disk usage is about 50G and new PC should have plenty of disk for that. Syncing is not so bad, maybe couple of days max.

Try to follow this guide for NewEnglandcoin (Nengcoin old name).  Nengcoin is litecoin clone so that method is quite similar with just name change. Dogecoin similar too. Change the coin name for litecoin and below guide should work well for your litecoin recovery. Also if your wallet has password protection, you will need that too to obtain old coins.  Lots of peole say exporting private key etc. I found that is difficult. Just use below method wallet file and full node wallet to recover everything:[https://www.reddit.com/r/NewEnglandCoin/comments/es4nbo/how\_to\_restore\_wallet\_using\_backed\_up\_wallet\_file/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewEnglandCoin/comments/es4nbo/how_to_restore_wallet_using_backed_up_wallet_file/)
Regardless of who helps you, becareful! A lot of scammers are here who will try to pery on people like you (uneducated/unware of how things work regarding wallets etc). They will try to ''help'' you and boom your coins are gone. Just my 2 cents. Please becareful!

The reason why gold may go down in price is because they are selling 'paper' gold that artificially saturates the market. Investors may invest in crypto, AS WELL. Nothing wrong with diversification. But allow me to paint you a picture... if power runs out, internet is shut down, or regulations change on crypto, it can easily go bust.  

The only risk with gold is if it gets stolen or lost. It can even survive a house fire.
This only thing that might go down is ""paper"" gold.

Nope - gold is gold and it‚Äôs under no threat."

Why does Litecoin need a lightning network. It's fast enough and cheap enough as it is
Exactly, Gresham's law also applies to the early history of gold and silver, gold is hoarded and pulled out of circulation, so people need something else to use as a currency (silver).

The ""per transaction"" metric is idiotic even if the numbers are correct. Five miners pulling a total of 1000w could process the same amount of transactions at any time as 50000 miners. More miners means more security. Bitcoin's flaw isn't the amount of miners, and therefore wattage consumed, it's the _overly_ slow block times, among other things. All of these coins with extremely short block times also have extremely high orphan rates. They are much less secure. They are much less efficient.

Do note that without Litecoin, Dogecoin's hashrate would plummet. Also note that if Dogecoin's fiat value continues to increase, its hashrate will also increase. More wattage. Those infinite blocks would immediately become much more desirable."

Hardware wallets include Trezor and Ledger. They‚Äôre pretty much the industry standard at this point. Make sure you buy direct from the manufacturer if you decide to use one of those. I use Ledger for cold storage, but most of my litecoin is in BlockFi earning interest.

Litecoin was a hard fork of Bitcoin so it basically has all the same components of Bitcoin with the exception of 84 million tokens rather than Bitcoin's 21 million tokens. Many people view Litecoin as a ""testnet"" of Bitcoin and it seems that many experimentations (if successful) gets implemented onto Bitcoin. One of the biggest updates coming onto Litecoin is MimbleWimble which is a privacy feature that will definitely benefit this cryptocurrency. If successfully launched, it will likely get updated onto Bitcoin. 

As a Litecoin hodler who has used both Bitcoin and Litecoin, I can say for certainty that Litecoin is much faster and cheaper to use. With MimbleWimble, transactions and wallet keys will be private which is a big deal. When it comes to using Litecoin as a digital currency, it does a far superior job than Bitcoin based on the whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto. 

Bitcoin seems to get most of the attention because it was the first player in the field. It's unlikely that Bitcoin will lose its attention any time soon but that doesn't mean that Litecoin doesn't have a purpose in crypto. It absolutely does and there is a reason why exchanges almost always lists Litecoin when they list Bitcoin.
Have faith.  Have patience.  Ltc is for the smart ones.  So u have to understand that thst being said, it will naturally catch on much later.  If smart investments is easy, everyone will be a bazillionairie.  My friend who mined eth told me that if I sold ltc before it hits 5000$ I am a dumbass."

991	I‚Äôm New to Crypto currency, is it better to buy the coin in a wallet, or a share using apps like Robinhood and Webull?	1612135409.0	13	"Buy it on an exchange where you own the coin. Not on Robinhood
Never buy on Robinhood. With crypto, they hold an IOU and will not give you access to your coins.
Use a real exchange. 

Buying from wallets incur high fees and slow transaction times.

Robinhood and PayPal don't really let you own or control your crypto.

I use Binance.US and Kraken."

996	what happened to litecoin's on chain statistic?	1605447161.0	14	"My uninformed, uneducated guess is that Litebringer game that takes place on the blockchain. Lots of small frequent transactions.
Average is still at the same [value](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactionvalue-ltc-sma7.html#6m) around **3.4 kUSD/transaction**, this shows that most transactions (at least half) are done with values around 5 USD, which is rather a good thing (exactly u/snakesbbq point). 

When the fees are high (e.g BTC) you can't transact these low values on chain.
curious about this as well.."

999	Virtual Server Host That Accepts Litecoin	1623831111.0	13	"Hi there,

In case you are looking for virtual server providers that accept Litecoin as a payment method, we would suggest checking our merchant directory:  [https://coingate.com/stores?q=virtual%20servers](https://coingate.com/stores?q=virtual%20servers)
One of my friends and a long time litecoiner runs a VPS renting company called [Privex](https://www.privex.io). They accept Litecoin, so you might be interested using them. They've even donated 3 servers to run critical infrastructure.
> A big problem (that I don't understand) is why Bitpay doesn't accept Litecoin

The real problem is why the merchants choose BitPay instead of running their own wallets. BitPay is a cancer on Bitcoin. Litecoin does not need BitPay  

Prices are better here than the other hosts you're using ...

> El Salvador

El Salvador is not using Bitcoin. They've appointed a monopoly provider to implement Bitcoin Lightning, using that provider's services and software. It's a centralized implementation of Bitcoin Lightning  

Litecoin wouldn't be able to handle the transaction volume to be a national currency, not in any country bigger than Nauru"
