Everyone in the comments has clearly never been to a remotely high end stylist for their hair. This isn't even as close to as expensive as it gets.

Congrats on getting paid in ETH.
$70 for a haircut? I‚Äôm in the wrong business"
1	Reddit announces partnership with the Ethereum Foundation	1611774902.0	7131	"We‚Äôre excited to have an ongoing relationship with Reddit and more collaboration as we work together to improve Ethereum for the entire ecosystem. We continue to be impressed with Reddit‚Äôs vision, and by how it maintains its culture and philosophies, which were key in forming this relationship. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how this evolves, and how it can benefit both Ethereum and the Reddit community. Thanks u/spez and u/jarins for your support!
These kind of announcements makes me pumped for the future of Ethereum üöÄ
Get this to r/all! Introduce Ethereum to Reddit! Great partnership!"

Who gives a flying fuck what he has to say?!?

He‚Äôs a self made man and I respect what he‚Äôs done but does he actually know anything about Bitcoin or is it that he has sooo much fiat, he needed something to invest in aside from his buildings?
Let's not forget that he [promoted](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/17/floyd-mayweather-backed-centra-tech-ico-founders-indicted-for-fraud/) the Centra Card, which proved to be a total fraud and the founders are now in jail."

5	"Goldman Sachs calls Ethereum ""The Amazon Of Information"" and sees it overtaking Bitcoin"	1621793629.0	5843	"what a stupid take. fuck these dimwitted bankers

Im tired of people using their takes to bolster ethereum's position. they add nothing.
I understand everybody has an opinion. I would recommend that more people read the white papers and understand the use cases. Everything in life needs context. 

As a lot of you comment Goldman Sachs may be blowing Sunshine up our butts. but I think one of the things they're trying to do is speak in language so their investors in the general public can understand things better.  

If people investigate, read, research and use critical thinking skills they can begin to understand the tremendous utility of ethereum, cardano and the infrastructure being put in place. It will change the world societies for the better, I believe.

Those of us that are true believers are in this for the long haul. But cash is a nice thing too.

Just my opinion. Add it to the pile of others.
Goldman Sachs is doing a hell of a job pumping Ethereum in the wrong direction today."

Anyone pay you in it?"
10	Poll: Should we ban NFT advertisements from r/Ethereum?	1614605510.0	4415	"Maybe have a single megathread

11	This sub is getting astroturfed by Bitcoin maximalists	1629393563.0	4355	"Moderating is a tough balance between keeping this place clean, but not wanting to censor others. I definitely don't think we should remove posts just because they're critical of Ethereum.

Personally, I was pretty mixed about that post. It didn't break any of this sub's rules, but there was definitely something odd with that post. When the top post of the week is just ignorant bashing of Ethereum, it definitely looks like brigading.

I've been talking with the other mods, and we're going to introduce some big changes in the next few weeks to try to reinvigorate this sub (the quality has dropped significantly in the last year or two).

Look out for some announcements, and as always, feel free to give us feedback on how we can best run this sub.

I don't get the doge noise.... I've been very publicly supportive of doge in all sorts of ways since like 2016. And still am; it's a much needed antidote to ""cryptocurrency is the FUTURE of SOUND MONEY and FREEDOM and it's the BIGGEST THING SINCE THE ~~INTERNET~~ WHEEL therefore we have to be VERY VERY SERIOUS"".
Hear hear! Turn the fucking car around and give the trolls a spanking. Tough love time."

14	‚ÄúEveryone is talking about Ethereum‚Äú at Bitcoin 2021	1622832156.0	4216	"When a new technology is thousands of times more useful than those that came before, its entrance into the mainstream is an inevitability.

15	Wonderful explanation of what's Ethereum.	1620266343.0	4032	"Don‚Äôt you still pay fees to make a transaction with Ethereum, I‚Äôm all for Ethereum and I think it is great. I‚Äôm a new investor and I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve completely wrapped my head around this. Smart contracts are great and I get that they remove the middle man, and it‚Äôs DeFi but if the whole point is to eliminate the fees, and we still pay gas fees to complete Ethereum transactions then doesn‚Äôt it somewhat defeat the purpose? I‚Äôd love for this to be clarify, someone knowledgeable please help!
Do you guys think smart contracts are some magical force of nature that get willed into existence? No! they require time and expertise to build and maintain, same as any software system. blockchain apps and services have front ends, marketing teams, legal teams, and all of the actors of a regular company. Uber doesnt take a cut because ""company bad."" they take a cut because they offer a service with a competitive advantage which people are willing to pay for.

The more I learn about this community, the more ignorance I discover. Sorry, but ethereum is not a magical secret sauce to an anarcho capitalist utopia.
Great job. Nice video. I have a question about the first sentence.

>> ‚ÄúEthereum is a cryptocurrency‚Äù

This is false... (right?)

Ethereum is not a cryptocurrency.  Ethereum is a blockchain platform that provides smart contract capability.  Many solutions can be, and have been, developed and implemented on this platform‚ÄîEther (a cryptocurrency) is one those.  Other crypto currencies are also built on the Ethereum platform.

18	This street art recently appeared in Melbourne, Australia.	1617685350.0	3837	"I'm a huge fan of eth and vitalik but lemme say 2 things.

1, this cult behavior brings nothing and is cringy (like the word itself).

2, its not good that eth has a ""face"", unlike btc.

Only my opinion.
I love it I just wish it was an eth instead of a lambo
I know we're all grateful for Vitalik's gigabrain, as well as his constant hard work at not only Ethereum research problems but also remaining even-tempered with critics; HOWEVER

he has said multiple times that he really doesn't care for being memed, especially like this where he's depicted as a deity.  I know this was done in good humour and not to mock him, but I wish that more people would take his request seriously.  It seems like he'd rather encourage all contributors to receive their fair share of credit, and this makes it seem like he's the only one who does anything.

He's a really awesome dude, who built a really awesome thing, and who continues to do really awesome work for it, but he's not a god and he's not infallible.  Let's keep V down to earth and relatable, so that he'll stick around for a while..."

31	Soon in the near future we will no longer use Dollars. We will only use Gweis and Sats.	1621223396.0	3111	"Ur gwei... haha. 

Sorry
Gwei is the denomination of ethereum aka ETH when the value of ETH becomes so crazy we it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to say how much ETH but how much gweis.

For example 15,637,388,822 gweis equals 1.5637388822 ETH but you‚Äôre not gonna say .000000001 ETH for a burger you‚Äôd say 1 gwei 

Basically a gwei millionaire would be similar to of a usd millionaire now but usd would be worth much less than a gwei in the near future so no one will even accept usd anymore.

So 1.5 ETH now could make you a multi millionaire in the future etc.

Same goes for sat for BTC.
You can scrap the *untraceable* part for 99% of crypto projects lol."

I did the same. Snagged a few free ETH this week.

I still hold some Doge hoping the price goes down to nothing again because I think it's a great introductory cryptocurrency without pumps and dumps. It was perfect for teaching my kids basic economic principles and how security works in cryptocurrency. 

Not going to lie I've been giving my kids dogecoin as rewards for chores for 3 years and now that the price has gone up it's basically just backfired on all economic principles I've tried to teach them with Dogecoin. My 15 year old owns 10,000 lol

You have the same exact arguments as nocoiners against crypto. Crypto is just code that anyone can take and fork and copy. My ETH clone has no value in your eyes? Your downloaded cryptopunk with no NFT ownership has no value in anyone's eyes.

How many posts have been made about ETH becoming deflationary and ""ultra-sound""? Isn't that celebrating increased scarcity which should raise the value of ETH? How is it impossible for something like Cryptopunks to have value given no more of the original set can be made?

I say this as someone that doesn't even own a single NFT because anything I like is too expensive. Dogging on them sounds exactly how Boomers reacted to Bitcoin.

So damn impressive how the public is taking to Ethereum. Makes me sleep well at night on my foundational pillow stack of ETH (and BTC!); however, each validator does not equal one unique entity. One entity, eg. Coinbase or Binance, can have thousands of validators. So validator count is not an indicator of decentralization.

Over 20,000 new validators were added to the network in the span of a month, taking the validators number from 180,000 to over 200,00.

Your answer for fees is far from being satisfying. Yes high fees will kill Eth. Your Nvidia example isn't the same thing. 

You know there are other successful blockchains coming strong. Avalanche for one has lots of Dapps on it. People will quit using Eth at some point if this doesn't change. Because other chains have already solved that problem...

And I wouldn't care about any supply problem for a global demand, because this won't be an issue. We all use Eth because we have to and we all know it.

118	A block was just mined with 112 ETH in rewards. This is out of control. It's time to activate EIP-1559.	1614008158.0	1572	"To be honest, this would have been same with EIP-1559 as well. If you take a look closely to gas prices its just about 10% of the transactions paying extreme amounts of gas to make it through the next block. You can assume those people would be tipping same amount after EIP1559 as well to make it to next block. 

This was an extreme amount of congestion that lasted longer than 1 hour. EIP1559 is not designed to help that, it is more useful for short spikes of congestion. EIP1559 increases the base fee 10 times for every 20 full blocks (25M gas). Today the base fee would have easily seen 2000 gwei if EIP1559 was in effect.
EIP1559 does NOT claim to nor will it reduce fees. I know it's confusing since it's the one thing the community wants to address and it's NOT being addressed in this EIP.
Most of the Ethereum old guard seems to have their head in the sand about this issue. Yes, Eth2 is an elegant solution that will eventually fix this problem.  But it won't be processing the majority of transactions until the next presidential administration. L2 may eventually help, but as of today it's all vaporware. We need a solution today. Otherwise the project will continue slowly bleeding users to chains that do offer a better user experience. 

There's a very simple solution. Even simpler than EIP-1559. It could be rolled out as a hard fork tomorrow. **Hard code a larger block gas limit**. Yes the miners will bitch and moan. They may even try splitting Ethereum. Let them try. The vast majority of actual users will migrate to the hard fork where transaction fees aren't $1,000+.

Let me be clear. This is a quick and dirty hack. But the technology graveyard is littered with projects that failed, because the engineers were too busy building the most elegant scalable solution, instead of getting a better product to market. Increase the block limit today. Then migrate to EIP-1559 in the medium term. Then in the long-term we'll move to Eth2 sharding. But if we don't fix this problem today, there won't be any Ethereum activity left in 2023 for Eth2."

The good news. This is being solved by:

- 1559 to improve UX and make gas estimation more consistent and means your transaction will get included despite gas price volatility. When: London hard fork.

- The merge to PoS and Data sharding to increase  Layer 1 throughput and hopefully reduce gas prices. When : later this year (the merge) and into next year (data sharding)

- Launch of Layer 2 solutions to take pressure off Layer 1 and provide quick and cheap execution for non-whales. When: Optimism and Starknet are on the horizon, but you can and should get familiar with Polygon and Loopring today.

129	Ethereum is transitioning from ‚ÄòRewards to miners‚Äô to ‚ÄòRewards to owners‚Äô.	1620151239.0	1517	"One correction here. Owners don‚Äôt receive rewards. Validators do.

Validators need to run equipment to maintain the network. And they need 32 ETH for each validators.

So there is a minimum ownership of ETH to validate yes, but otherwise they aren‚Äôt a lot different than miners. Their just paid a lot less. And I guess the 32 ETH makes sure they have too much cash in the game to harm the network so it keeps them honest.
If some miners stop mining because they don't find the rewards enticing enough, that means less competition for the remaining miners and a bigger share of the remaining rewards. Hashrate might go down a bit but it's unlikely to drop to a 'dangerous' level before miners chasing the most profitable coin get tempted back, especially in the current range of ETH prices.
Burning the fee rewards current holders, and greatly harms future, and poorer investors or holders. The Eth team needs to think generational rather than now, now.

If Eth is worth too much then it becomes useless outside of being a store of currency which defeats the entire point of why I, and many others were initially interested.

I wanted the next iteration of the internet, something free, and outside of the control of those in power. What we are being delivered, however, is another vehicle for the wealthy to retain control while locking out the poorest from even attempting to use any of the amazing possibilities that Eth could have provided, and may yet with wise decision making.

If everything is on a higher layer to avoid transactional fees then at what point are we back to everything being no different than it is now?"

Re his point on sov, institutions will flock to eth from btc after pos as ether is not only much more eco friendly(ie good pr
especially with Biden massive green push) but also  doesn't present the geopolitical risk of btc being beholden to China.
I agree. I was explaining to friends, trying to draw a parallel between Crypto and traditional investments. I think I found a good analogy.

Real Estate is always a good sound investment. Not only is Real Estate a limited resource, thus has a natural hedge against inflation, but Real Estate can also be leverage as an asset into additional spaces of investment. The mere fact that  you own land, opens the possibility of other ventures, such as running a farm, building malls/apartment complexes, etc. These can gain profits *on top* (pun intended) of the asset that is already gaining value.

Bitcoin, at the moment, doesn't have a landscape (pun not intended) to be leveraged into additional ventures. Ethereum can, and will. Ethereum's SoV status is compounded by any service running atop Ethereum, just as Real Estate's value is compounded by whatever services require Real Estate to function.

The added benefit we're seeing that is a new dynamic, is that this asset you own also is required to participate, adding some global scaling of value. So if you purchase Ethereum and stake it, you gain APY on an asset that is limited in supply, has entire economic systems built on top of it, all while the global supply is being burned for it to operate, which increases the value of your base investment, APY, and any stake in services hosted on Ethereum (e.g. governance tokens, NFTs)."

Forget BNB's inflated market cap (I call BS just like I do with Tether). When BNB has within 1/10th the amount of wallet addresses, and/or when developers are piling into their platform, then it's time to worry. Until then, it's another diversion like dogecoin for fools to stumble over.
If decentralization is a real benefit ( it is) then they can't compete in the long term.
I haven't been that concerned with the rise of Binance.  In fact, this is probably the best thing that can happen to Ethereum.  You want people to play around on a pseudo decentralized chain like BSC while gas prices are so high.  Let them learn to use Metamask and learn to swap coins, etc.  It only expands the market.  Ultimately, BSC will fail if their goal is to replace Ethereum.  Only a fully decentralized chain can win long term.  Do you think Bitcoin would still be around today if there was a person (CZ) governments could subpoena?  Hardly...

My vision for the future is a solar system, with Ethereum 2.0 (L1) as the sun, and lots of different projects (planets) circulating around Ethereum's L1:  BSC, Polkadot, Cosmos, Ethereum L2's, Solana, etc.  

So how to play this?  Ethereum core devs should stay focused and continue to deliver according to plan.  That is our key success factor, God bless 'em.  Ethereum will win, if they, and the community, stay focused on 2.0.

Also, look at projects that connect all of this together, the ""gravity"" that holds the planets in orbit around the sun.  Projects like REN, RUNE, and others that help connect our multichain worlds together.  They will be key over the next 3-5 years.  Not just for BSC, but for all of the projects that come on line over 2021/22.  There will be a lot, and connectivity is key.

Also, to any Ethereum maximalists out there, please stop having breakdowns on Twitter and Reddit around BSC, it's embarrassing.  You are making things much worse by freaking out over this.  BSC is a gift, having a credible, properly decentralized chain suck away a lot of business would be much worse.  You are so lucky CZ is there to give people a playground until 2.0 is out.  Because 50-70 USD gas costs per smart contract transaction are insane, and 99% of real people will not do this with their 3k USD total balances."

143	Vitalik Buterin: Ethereum 2.0 Will Bring Scalability and Open the Door to More Dapps and Enterprise Use Cases	1623568653.0	1405	"Herald sheets is 2/10 for quality.

Please don‚Äôt repost.
tldr; Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum, has stated that Ethereum will bring scalability and help open the door to more decentralized applications (Dapps) and enterprise use cases. He also discussed the importance of building diverse, open-source communities. Vitalik added that the transition of Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake will reduce the resource requirements of the network by over 1000x.

I'm about as big a bull as it gets regarding Ethereum. That being said, Q1 2022 is way more realistic. I just don't see it being any earlier. The spec isn't finalized yet and the amount of testing that will be needed across all the clients in the execution layer and the beacon chain to confidently work in harmony for this monumental shift is not insignificant. I'm happy if I'm proven wrong though.
How is eth being scarce good for everyone though? Sure seems like it‚Äôs best for those who already have eth.

The current process of mining is clearly not the way, but I am also super unclear of why everyone seems so happy with proof of stake which removes any technical or knowledge barriers and just makes it about who has the most capital to spend."
149	How convince my friends to buy productive coins like ETH instead of Dogecoin	1618850476.0	1372	"My Honest advice‚Ä¶ you do you man and let them make mistakes that‚Äôs how you learn so oh well
Congratulate them on their gains, be there when they lose. Money is an extremely emotionally sensitive subject like family, politics, or religion. Here‚Äôs how it goes:
* If you tell them to get out, they do, and the price appreciates they will pin that lost opportunity on you.
* If you tell them to get out, they don‚Äôt, and the price drops they will pin their jealousy on you.
* If you tell them to buy a different coin, they do, and the price drops they will pin their loss on you.
* If you tell them to buy a different coin, they do, and the price appreciates they will congratulate themselves.
You shouldn't do that imo. Just help them if they ask you questions."
150	Deep diving on the whitepapers. I want to understand this at its depths.	1619718662.0	1359	"read silmarillion first, then btc and finally eth. that‚Äôs the order.

151	As a Bitcoin holder, Eth makes complete sense to me.	1622991613.0	1362	"Why wouldn't ETH work as a store of value?
What makes you think BTC can't be replaced as a store of value? I'd definitely get those holdings closer to 50/50. Probably better to be something like 40/40/20 - 20% shit coin shotgun spread but do some research.

In my mind BTC is the Wright Flyer, a revolutionary, species defining, invention. Unfortunately for it though, it exists in a time that moves much faster than things did back then. So while it was a revolution, and an evolution for our species, a thousand projects of ""similar merit"" have popped up with the advantage of knowing everything and more that was learnt from Bitcoin.

There is still a lot to unfold to this story, so I honestly wouldn't count on any of the current market leaders to solidify that position.

I also think it's beneficial to look at these things as networks instead of as dollars or gold. When you approach it this way BTC really shows its age. Even ETH 2.0 ends up being behind the curve. Being the biggest fastest, most useful network isn't everything, but I think it's going to matter.

One more thing I want to add is in regards to store's of value in general. Even the big institutions like Goldman-Sachs don't seem to be able to fully appreciate how they work. Store's of value undergo massive generational shifts. Fine wine is a good example of this, as you'll see they are included by many as being a store of value. Millennials though don't give a fuck about fine wine, and we know none of you can tell the difference. I wouldn't put my money in wine. I also won't be putting any money into Bitcoin. A good store of value has good utility, and these utility requirements tend to shift with the times.
I‚Äôm of the same mind. But you gotta ask this in the btc subs, not here I think."

I was about to make a post about this then saw yours. The fact that Robinhood literally BANNED BUYING is a PERFECT example of why DEX's built on Ethereum are not just good, they need to become the FUCKING INDUSTRY STANDARD. FUCK the exchanges.
Just to clear some misconceptions from above, trading halts did happened quite a lot today, but the bigger issue was what caused it. ([https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current](https://www.nyse.com/trade-halt-current))

Trading apps such as Robinhood and brokerages such as IBKR, decided to only allow users to SELL certain stocks (GME included) and prohibited BUYING of said stocks. All this while allowing institutional players (hedge funds) to do as they please. 

This essentially allowed institutions to manipulate the price of the security as well as recover their positions and scare retail investors making it appear that the price has crashed.

""DeFi ....lending platforms...might eventually pose a challenge to banks, Wall Street firms and insurance companies. But not now, says the bank.""

The currently popular DeFi apps will only challenge traditional banks if these old banks sit on the sidelines and do nothing. There is nothing preventing Bank of American from coding its own smart contracts and offering these services to their customers. 

‚ÄúCredit creation is one of the key motors of modern finance. As yet, DeFi doesn‚Äôt do anything like this""

DeFi is growing fast because the network is enabling users to create their own personal credit without a middle man and available 24/7. If I own $50k of Ethereum, I can lend this to the network at 0.19% APR. I can then borrow against my collateral and create credit at reasonable rates. In this scenario, I maintain exposure to ETH, I receive access to credit, and the lending interest rate pays for the my credit interest payments."

FYI the semiconductor chip production is among the most fast-paced and complex industries out there.

Just in case someone needs to have some further information about the person u/Eildosa to crack the puzzel, here is what I came up with during a quick search:

He is from, France, probably 33 years old, 179cm tall, weighs \~90 kg, smoking and has asthma and an anxiety disorder (\[source deleted\]). You can find his stackoverflow account here. So he is an IT guy proficient with C, C++, C#, java, python. Furthermore, he has interest in gaming, DNA sequencing, ketogenic diet and Cannabidiol. His phone is probably running Android. The latter info can be found in his reddit post history.

One of his wallets is \[this (deleted)\] (\[source deleted\]), which probably also makes \[that one (deleted)\] his.

Edit: u/Elidosa, after seeing your edit of the original post, I see that you were not aware of all the personal things you have revealed over time. Hopefully, it is a lesson to you. Everything you put on the internet has to be considered public. However, my intention was not to do harm in any way. Rather understanding what kind of mindset might have been involved during cipher construction (language background, age, interests etc). Since you have deleted all the linked posts and changed your stackoverflow username, I am going to remove the references to break up the connection to your new accounts/usernames.

Same thing happened to me. Paid 10$ first then they wanted a furtber 65$. They should really tell you the full price before you pay the initial fee. Lost 10$
I had a similar adventure yesterday.

I installed MetaMask and started using it for the first time ever. I perceived it as ""some app you need to have installed to access some web3 services, such as Uniswap"". So I did it.

Then I sold some different altcoins to get $100 of ETH. Transfer from Coinbase to Metamask - paid very minimal fees (0 coinbase fee, very small network/transaction fee), and it arrived fast.

Then I tried MetaMask and its ""Swap"" feature. Like, I wanted 10$ of Chainlink. And then I got greeted by a 40$ (network) fee.

Then I go into Metamask advanced settings to try and lower my gas cost. Get errors that wont allow.

Then I go to Uniswap site directly, cuz that was my initial goal. Same thing, massive fees, but now I can go into advanced settings and lower my gas costs, cuz the settings are not disabled.

welp - the two transactions I tried, both failed, and I lost \~15$. I'm gonna put it down as ""Education costs/expenses"".

I mean, I THINK I understand the reasons why they happened, and I don't feel like I got scammed, nor that it was an unfair situation. I'm just bummed that the network fees are so high.

But what I do feel is anxious. I can't wait for the several updates that ETH 2.0 has lined up for next year, to make using Eth much more convenient and efficient. It feels like the year \~2000, and using the Internet then.

It seems that there were a lot of transactions for bulk buys of this token in a short amount of time. Gas fees seemingly went up around the time the tokens first started being sold and went back down after all 10,000 were sold. I have no idea what this token is, I will assume it's some pump and dump. Anyways, gas fees seem to be back down now.

UPDATE 2: After gas fees went down to around 15, they shot back up to around 450, even higher than before. What is going on???

UPDATE 3: Many people are looking at this post and the current gas fees and are calling my post misleading, so I'd like to clarify. Yesterday, gas fees went from 10 to around 200 gwei, and then back down to 20 in a period of about 30 minutes. After that, it spiked back up to nearly 450 gwei, before coming back down to 10 about 30 minutes later.

In a space where putting your trust in something could mean losing all your money, legitimacy signals trust like a lighthouse in the night.

This applies to coins, tokens, protocols, networks, dapps, etc etc etc. It is 100% why bitcoin will never disappear, even if the age of smart contract native networks overshadow it. It is why Ethereum will never disappear, even if another smart contract native network touts better features and scaling. It is why UniSwap, although plagued by high gas fees the past few months, is still a big player in the space.

I also love ETH due to its development angle but when things like this starts happening which are beyond logic then we as a community have to ask questions.
Is it just me, or is Arbitrum super underrated?

They've had a public testnet running for months (whereas Optimism still hasn't officially released a testnet), they have great docs, no crazy drama, and now it looks like they'll probably launch before Optimism.

So... why is everyone putting all their hope on Optimism?

234	How ETH 2.0 will help with scaling	1617882540.0	867	"If you ever see the term ‚ÄúEth 2.0‚Äù or ‚ÄúEthereum 2.0‚Äù used instead of just ‚ÄúEth2‚Äù, then you know the information is either six months or so out of date, or the person speaking isn‚Äôt up to speed with the latest Ethereum development roadmap.

The next milestones for Eth2 (the beacon chain), are The Merge and Data Sharding.

Computational sharding as described in this video is no longer being considered a priority, but Vitalik wrote a good post earlier today to bring this discussion back to the forefront and to dispel some myths.
Way over my head. Sounds cool as hell though.
My gut reaction to the title was ""it won't,"" ""it can't,"" and finally ""that makes no fucking sense""

243	This is why EIP 1559 is good- and why Vitalik, developers and most community members support it. If miners have a problem with it, then please argue your case in a livestream with the actual researchers and developers. I'll bring the popcorn.	1613350266.0	844	"Summary of EIP 1559 benefits:

* Significantly improves user wallet UX.
* Blunts the primary criticism from BTC maximalists that ETH issuance is ""infinite.""
* Reduces ETH issuance without reducing network security.
* Makes it harder for mining pools and others to front-run trades.
* Reduces network spam.

While some have mentioned that EIP 1559 will have a net-positive effect on transaction fees, that is not its primary purpose. L2 rollup tech will have the largest near-term benefits for transaction fees. ETH 2 (data sharding) will scale transactions even more down the road.
I am both a long term 6GPU small time hobby miner (making 0.01 ETH/day - woohoo) and relatively small time ETH holder. Let's do EIP 1559 because the community wants this, and I believe in the long term potential of the ethereum community -- not my miner output. 

I am currently using sparkpool. Is there another pool I could join (preferably with nodes in China...) that supports EIP-1559? It seems this is the most practical argument to make to miners. Very few of us solo mine, and if we are told how to join a pool that supports EIP-1559 we'll vote en masse with our relatively small rigs.
Can miners harm the transition from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0? Can they make it harder for EIP 1559 to be implemented? What can they do to hinder the process and is the transition at risk because of their short sightedness?"

this will make Eth the fastest, cheapest Crypto for transacting.  So it should overtake bitcoin.  Jack wants you to be able to pay an uber driver or coffee barista - so it has to be fast.  Elon doesn't want it to be expensive or energy intensive. Both sides are going to demand faster cheaper crypto - as long as it remains secure and decentralized.

Most of the public will just see it as a ponzi scheme unless it can be attached to a store of value. NFT of ETFs of stocks like QQQ or SPY will likely be it.

So, a few years from now, expect to pay uber or buy coffee with a faster cheaper Crypto than using Mastercard that represents a fractional share of QQQ.  We are still in flip phone stage.  i-phone of Crypto hasn't fallen yet.

You'd have to give everyone a government-issued key pair and teach them to keep it safe, which is a challenge administratively and politically.
I'm somewhat more bullish on this idea than many other people, but it is important to understand the very subtle concerns at play.

**WARNING: long technical answer incoming but I have tried to make it as accessible as a technical deep dive realistically can be.**

First of all, a voting system has many very specific requirements that it must meet in order to be secure, some of which are counterintuitive and stricter than what you might expect. Paper-based voting satisfies all of these requirements. There are different ways of stating these requirements; this is simply my presentation.

* Correctness (the result actually is the correct result given what the votes were, and each voter can only vote once)
* Only registered voters can vote (this is easy: the voting authority maintains a list of public keys and enforces the one-per-person rule, and this can be made publicly verifiable)
* Censorship resistance (if you want to vote and are eligible, nobody can prevent you from voting, and your vote gets counted)
* Privacy (no one can see how you voted, or even whether or not you voted)
* Coercion resistance (you can't prove to a third party how you voted, even if you wanted to and even if you and the third party were cooperating throughout the process)

The first and third can be solved easily with ZK-SNARKs; it would be a simple retool of Zcash or tornado.cash. The second can be provided with a blockchain (yay!). But the fourth (very important to prevent selling votes) is much harder.

It turns out that there is cryptographic technology that can solve the fourth, but it requires a trusted intermediary. It basically involves everyone publishing their votes encrypted with the intermediary's public key, and the intermediary publishes a ZK-SNARK of decrypting the messages and verifying the result (there's also a bit of trickery that allows voters to change their keys to trick anyone trying to coerce them or buy their vote). The intermediary has no way to break the first three guarantees, but they can do one of two nasty things:

1. They can prevent anyone from learning the result at all, forcing the election to be repeated with a different intermediary
2. They can run a trustless vote selling marketplace

This is actually already not that bad, because both forms of attack are highly visible and can lead to the intermediary being quickly replaced. But if we want added security, we can do one of a few things:

1. We can put the intermediary's software code inside SGX, preventing the intermediary's secret key from being used to do anything but compute the result and the proof (thereby preventing vote selling) as long as EITHER (i) the intermediary is honest OR (ii) the SGX works
2. We can use [multi-party computation](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/12/26/secret-sharing-daos-crypto-2-0/) to turn the intermediary into an M-of-N system, so you can choose eg. 10 participants where 5 of them would need to collude to stall the election or run a vote selling marketplace

[MACI](https://github.com/appliedzkp/maci) is an implementation of the above (though without MPC) and is being used for quadratic funding via [CLRfund](http://clrfund.eth.link/) already. There is also a 20-year-long academic discipline trying to create electronic voting systems, and it has settled on [solutions with very similar properties](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/165.pdf), except with the MPC already baked in as part of the protocol.

Now, we get to the question that the academic cryptographer might ask: what's the point of using a blockchain instead of just using one of these academic schemes. To answer this, we should first compare and contrast the blockchain-based approach and these traditional approaches. To achieve correctness while preserving privacy, the schemes are similar; the only difference is that the traditional approaches use special-purpose proofs whereas MACI uses ZK-SNARKs. To preserve privacy itself, all the schemes rely on some form of encryption, where a decryption key is secret-shared between N participants. To achieve coercion resistance, basically all the schemes rely on some ability to give third parties invalid keys that they cannot tell are invalid. **But to achieve censorship resistance, the two schemes are different**: traditional schemes piggyback on the same N participants that hold the secret key, whereas blockchain based schemes use a different N - the entire community maintaining the blockchain.

We should note also that while the _current_ version of MACI has the property that the intermediary (or the M-of-N if it's upgraded to a decentralized intermediary) can break privacy, future versions can be designed with more layers of ZK tech to allow a stronger zero-knowledge property, where the intermediary cannot even break privacy; they can only break coercion resistance.

To summarize:

* Traditional schemes: small N (like a permissioned blockchain) for coercion resistance AND for censorship resistance
* Blockchain based schemes: small N for coercion resistance, large N for censorship resistance

Clearly, the second is better than the first. If you are someone in a more traditional academic background, this may not come naturally, however, as you might be used to maximizing the number of things that need to break to _any failure to happen at all_; the idea that 5 units of protection against X and 20 units of protection against Y is better than 5 units of protection against both X and Y is imo systematically undervalued (you can see this bias in consensus algorithm literature all the time).

In particular, a failure of coercion resistance is less bad than a failure in censorship resistance. If some people's votes get suppressed, and they have no way to prove it, this is utterly terrible for a voting system. But if the intermediaries collude and run a vote selling marketplace, then if they do it at scale, this will be publicly known and the vote could be stopped and the intermediaries replaced. So having a small N (smaller cost but less security) for coercion resistance and a large N (higher cost but more security) for censorship resistance is actually optimal! And this is exactly what blockchain based voting provides.

Finally, the caveats:

1. Blockchains need to be scalable for this to be possible. Eth2 sharding (even data sharding alone) is sufficient; its data layer would be able to process all votes for an election with 100M voters in less than 1 day.
2. ZK-SNARK tech needs to improve.
3. The teams that are technically competent enough to understand the above, and the usual teams shilling ""yay blockchain voting!!!1!"" are not the same
4. I strongly oppose doing any of the above at scale until it's very well-tested in smaller contexts (local elections and non-governmental things, eg. quadratic funding in the ethereum community and maybe decentralized social media systems, go first)
5. This all requires average users to have secure computing environments. We as a crypto community should work hard toward this. You can check out Qubes OS, some of the recent open-hardware mobile phones, and other recent work for existing examples, though keep in mind that having it in the hands of geeks and having it in the hands of average users are two very different problems.

Hmm so you‚Äôre telling me that there exists a secure digital accounts system that allows me to sign into any app or website from one master ‚Äúaccount‚Äù, create a digital web page, and send and receive payments anywhere in the world for a fraction of a cent all while being completely recoverable using a trusted social network assuming you forget your password or something happens to you with absolutely zero trust or reliance on the apps/websites or third parties to securely store your account? 

Hmm sounds like a pretty sweet upgrade to the current internet if this saw absolute mass adoption. This sounds like it can centralize a users security and activities immensely simplifying everything from a UX perspective. You can use it as a bank account, identity verification tool, payment system, and much much more.

Are we a long way to go from this? Probably but if there are improvements to be made to something, I don‚Äôt care what people say, humans will eventually adopt them.

She‚Äôs using AtomicHub which runs on EOS.
Thank you everyone for your questions, comments, and answers. I really appreciate several answers that went into greater detail than I could possibly, so thank you very much.

I created these NFTs as digital gifts for patrons who participate in a drawing I am holding to win an original art piece. Creating a digital asset seemed like a fun and creative way to further engage with my supporters, whilst also speaking to the times we‚Äôre in with blockchain technology. I am more or less a lay person when it comes to all of this, but I do know we‚Äôre going to continue to see NFT/digital assets proliferate not only the current crypto communities but also industries at large. 

I wrote an article, [here](https://app.voice.com/post/@stacy/how-i-turned-my-artwork-into-nfts-1612053988-50948770), where I discuss using my NFTs as gifts, and as ways of further engaging with my patrons‚Äîand, potentially even other communities in the future. I did throw a few up in a marketplace to experiment, but giving gifts to my supporters is the objective of my project. I plan to include them in future projects as well. 

The buying and selling are only a couple aspects of NFTs.  They can be used in games, as collectables, for trading, artwork, community building/DACs, to vote, as engagement incentives, rewards, and the list goes on.

Right now, we appear to be in a bit of the Wild Wild West with NFTs. Many, such as myself, are curious and want to play around. I also saw what I thought was a fun opportunity to spread the energy of pro blockchain architecture and engagement. I‚Äôm also a content creator on Voice, one of the social media platforms running on a blockchain (in this case, EOSIO). 

I think all of this is the future being created now, and it‚Äôs exciting and full of possibility/potential. I look forward to learning a lot more about all of this, perhaps from some of you!"

Should be ""Layer 2"" instead of ""ETH 2.0"". Layer 2 provides scalability right now, ETH 2.0 scalability gains will not be seen for at least a year. 

Layer 2 solutions such as zk-rollups exist right now and are basically as good as an L1 transaction. Loopring has been online for over a year now. This is pro/con list specific to the Loopring platform since it is the oldest proper L2 solution on the main net. I'm not shilling Loopring, it's just the only project I know enough about to generate this list.

**Pros**:

* They are fully trustless (anyone can withdraw their funds at any time without the permission of anyone else).
* No need to set up an account to receive funds (you can send funds straight to someone's L1 address).
* Transaction fees are so low that they are being fully subsidized by Loopring (literally less than a penny to transact).
* There is a Automated-Market-Maker on their L2 (Uniswap-like experience).

**Cons**:

* Currently not immune to censorship like L1 (Loopring runs the relayer and could choose not to include certain transactions).
 * I don't think they have ever done this, but it is a real possibility.
* Initial onboarding to L2 and withdrawal from L2 is significantly more expensive than a simple L1 transaction.
* Liquidity in their AMM is rubbish right now.
* No composability with contracts that don't live on their L2.
 * *This is the main problem IMO, Ethereum's network effect is a function of its composability.*
This is definitely true. I started collecting Ether because I have a ton of ideas about how to use Web3. However, even basic back-of-the-envelope math says this sort of thing is not practical until we have consistently cheap token transactions.

The advantage that bitcoin has over every other crypto including Ethereum has nothing to do with innovation. It‚Äôs the monetary policy and it‚Äôs scarcity.

In fact because bitcoin is meant as a store of value that will eventually store trillions of dollars of wealth, the most important thing for its success is security and that will slow innovation as security and reliability is more important. Ethereum will be successful too but these comparisons don‚Äôt make sense and it‚Äôs completely irrelevant to say Ethereum is more innovative and has more use cases, etc. There is nothing bigger than money itself (global money) and when the rest of the world starts storing wealth in bitcoin there is no other crypto that can or ever will become more valuable.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*
Do GAS fees count in that total?
Not a great article. There is an absolute direct causal relationship between the creation of The Graph and the increase in activity we've seen on Ethereum since 2019.

There was never an ability to easily create decentralized applications on Ethereum until The Graph was created. Uniswap, Aave, yearn, Balancer, Maker, Compound, Sushiswap, you name it all rely upon and began to thrive because of The Graph. At this point, if it's a dApp, and they have users and active developers, they're most likely using a subgraph on The Graph to index their data.

Either way, ETH is the king of smart contracts, but without The Graph, Ethereum is extremely hard to build on and without The Graph, Ethereum wouldn't have come close to having $8 trillion settled on its network in 2021."

tldr; In 2017 there is a new place for ideas (crazy ones included) to emerge, incubate, and flourish: the internet.

Nah, I'm still on the waitlist. It's just you + some lucky others, not everyone. :((
Definitely a convenient service! But PSA: when staking in this way, you're essentially casting a vote for someone to operate. (If you've got 32 ETH and devops experience and money for hardware and a stable, uncensored internet connection and an uninterruptible power supply you can vote for yourself.)

Anyway the people you stake with will have a similar job as miners do now. That is, they'll make new blocks. If any one exchange (or staking group, or whatever) gets a large enough percentage of staked ETH, it poses a risk to the decentralization of Ethereum network. 

Decentralization is one of the reasons we can trust applications and transactions on the system to work as expected (and therefore have value) so it's a practical and financial concern as well as a political and philosophical one.

Apart from the reliability of the party you're staking to, the % return promised, and the terms of your stake agreement, (all of which seem pretty ok on coinbase tbh) you might want to factor this into your decision."

This is going to get so messy.
YESSSSSSSSSSS this is what I've been waiting for as a non-technical. They can take massive fees IDGAF. Also alleviates the fear of a power outage/ways of getting penalized. While I personally don't care about liquidity, many do, so I'm glad they're alleviating this concern as well.

I know everyone on this sub be like ""not your keys not your coins"" whateva. Been trying to stake the past month and 4 technical friends of mine quit on me trying to figure this out. You know how damn salty I was reading last week that beacon chain got filled and I wasn't able to get in, despite my best efforts? This is the best option for normies like me trying to support Eth 2.0.

Does the Eth2 earned from staking come from fees in Eth transactions or is it newly minted (similar to mining)?

* Another top pair is `ETH-UNIV3` - this is also a scam, there is no Uniswap v3 token
* As expected, stablecoin pairs are starting out at the 0.05% fee tier and ETH-DAI starting at 0.3%
* Pools analytics page doesn't have a '% APY' anymore due to new LP NFTs
* It seems something [strange](https://i.imgur.com/dlPy4vh.png) is going on with how TVL is calculated on the analytics page
* According to [a user](https://reddit.com/r/UniSwap/comments/n5ob3v/_/gx2oufc/?context=1) on /r/Uniswap, it is easier to manipulate the TVL on Uniswap v3, so total liquidity might not mean much right now
Looks like huge gas fees to add liquidity.

Uniswap v2 adding liquidity for a USDC-USDT pair had a [~150K gas cost](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xba1ea86e6051c82802f63e00d4802ecdf8670d6a2fa77ff19396eebf5e4c2c67/).

Uniswap V3 for same pair has a nearly [~500k gas cost](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x635a14d35a4275d02c1cdf0b8e4a3b07283c097fc1bbab8b43860a90f17e9014).

The capital efficiency should blunt the impact of the increased cost for liquidity providers but Uniswap might chew through even more gas with this change.

383	Why has the chain capacity increased by ~9% after London? Three answers...	1629004973.0	456	"I was wondering why the average gas fees seem to have nearly doubled just after the London hardfork even though (in my approximation) the amount of TPS should have gone up slightly. 

I'm glad that you did this research. I was trying to figure how the TPS should be affected post London and I figured that the TPS should increase slightly because blocks used to 'only' be able to have a maximum of 15M gas and there were always pending transactions so this would mean (I assume) that every block that wasn't mined empty should have been full since miners have the incentive to fill a block and collect the fee. 15M gas used. Almost any two sequential blocks should average to 15 M gas used. ((15 + 15)) /2) = 15M

But now we have a little fluff room that allows for a block to be 30M. Yes, the fee will raise in response to this, but the next block is almost never 0% full after a 200% full block is mined (probably because people submit transactions after the increase in base fee has been calculated) ((30 + 4) / 2) = 17M. (The 4 is just any arbitrary number higher than 0)

This seems to me that the gas of any two sequential blocks averaged together post london should almost always be higher than any two sequential blocks mined pre London. 

My two questions now are, why are some empty blocks mined? And is this just anecdotal evidence that fees are higher now, or did the number of transactions increase by the ratio of the gas fees?
what I don't understand is why there is such a large variation in blocksize right now. Admittedly I haven't researched it, but naively I'd expect miners to always include any and all transactions that have a tip or a legacy fee in excess of the basefee, because it's basically free money, right? But it seems they're not always doing that, they emit a block with little gas used and then one block later another miner takes all those transactions that weren't included and emits a block with close to 30M gas used. Why leave money on the table?
could I ask why you mean by ""Ice Age""?"

387	I have an idea - and can't stop thinking about it. Perhaps you could help?	1622195030.0	438	"can‚Äôt help you with details but it‚Äôs refreshing to read a real-world related post from a like-minded person instead of news-articles, personal sob stories or memes. 

saying so, i hope you‚Äòll find answers and keep us posted about your progress. would love to join you in this project with having 10+ experience in leading teams, but geographically i doubt there‚Äôs any chance to come by :)
It's an interesting idea, but presumably if you are putting in the capital to start the business and pay the rent etc it would have to start off as a traditional business, and the DAO would come later.

Just to be clear, you understand that this would mean you wouldn't end up as the decision maker or owner of the business? DAO's tend to distribute governance tokens, whether through sale or airdropped to users. Then any token holder can make proposals and interested token holders can vote on these proposals to determine changes going forward.

If you went along the airdropped distribution method (like UniSwap) this might mean giving tokens away to people who use the coffeeshop, which would probably make sense from an objective perspective... the people who use the business the most would end up with the most control over it, but you are effectively giving away the company you paid for. I also have no idea what the taxation issues or legal ramifications would be... but it would be interesting to find out!

If on the other hand you sold the tokens via some kind of ICO type process then you'd need to define what the difference between that and a shareholder model would be.

Like I said, it's an interesting thing to think about and I'm definitely keen to read what other people suggest regarding this concept!
This concept is simply a co-operative business model - I don‚Äôt know where you are, but this is pretty common in the UK and I work in one currently. Check out the Employee Ownership Association for some more info on how this could work

Legally you would set up a trust which owns 100% of the business (rather than an individual) and then the employees all have a joint share in that trust. Profit sharing can then be apportioned out based on wages/seniority in the company etc (or everyone can get an even split but that tends to lead to resentment from people who work more/longer/harder)

The question would be how you would use DAO to enhance the above - the DAO model would go a step further and allow all employees to make decisions for the business, fully decentralising the management of it.

This puts your capital in the hands of baristas - something you may or may not be comfortable with. A fair aportioning of risk should accompany decision making power - at which point you would need to ask employees to ‚Äúbuy in‚Äù to the company and stake their own capital to join‚Ä¶ it is likely to be very difficult to attract Baristas with enough money to buy a portion of a business, in order to share the profits of the business at a later date.

DAO is a really interesting business model but is more suited to businesses where everyone is already at a similar level of risk/reward in terms of capital staked, decision making ability etc.

THAT SAID, cooperatives are amazing and I genuinely think they run better than more traditional models - I strongly encourage you to carry on with this line of thinking, and an employee owned coffee shop with profit share and a committee model for decisions and a flat hierarchy is definitely possible.

Blockchain could be an interesting way to hold the trust and ensure everyone has real ownership of it, regardless of whether DAO is pursued."

given that, it focuses specifically on ""the merge"" between eth1 and eth2, where PoW is hot swapped for ""Proof of Stake"". I omitted terms like ""Beacon Chain"" because casual observers may not be aware of what that refers to. The key info to get across was that POS exists now and will eventually replace POW, and that the state is maintained even through the swap.

I've also made more complex diagrams ([see here](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1321936246332104705?s=20), when the focus was on strictly ordered Phases), but the language here was intentionally limited. it also saw a few rounds of review from eth2 devs, but I am always interested to hear constructive criticisms about what this does and does not convey!

This would only be true if there was a limited amount of green energy and/or we were at the peak of what investments in green can give us. Realistically green energy is early enough that more investments in it today can easily lead to more green energy in the future quicker by incentivising faster development and deployment of relevant tech.

I agree with the general point but it's hard to argue for that with such certainty. None of the later PoW projects had quite as strong a team and people involved in it which might explain some of it.

416	How does EIP 1559 impact Gas issues?	1617110118.0	395	"The miners do not choose a fee they are ‚Äúwilling‚Äù to accept. That is nonsense. It is a bidding system in which users are bidding based on the current average gas price. The highest paid gas in the mempool of pending transactions gets processed first in the next block. Supply and demand, more transactions and the users bid up the price for speed of transaction. However auction style bidding is very inefficient and users end up having to overpay to secure a speedy transaction because of the risk of average gas price rapidly rising. EIP 1559 does not lower gas prices, it stabilizes them by implementing a network determined base fee and eliminating the bidding system. The burning of fees is to disincentivize the creation of artificial traffic by miners to drive up the base fee for greater profits.
In short, instead of users choosing/guessing the Gas price to push their transaction, the network will propose a minimum Gas fee that will guarantee the transaction will be pushed through timely.

Also (not covered in this video but talked about in the [full episode](https://youtu.be/lm-Zu2PWDLg)):

* Fees will get burned instead of going to the miners (ETH becomes a store of value)
* Gas prices should be reduced although there is some [debate](https://cryptopotato.com/eip-1559-might-not-lower-the-high-ethereum-transaction-fees-report/) around that

Does this have any impact on reorgs?


One aspect I've been wondering is how sharding impacts the confirmed block height of a transaction before companies consider it to be safe to be included and processed internally. As an example, I think many companies treat a confirmed block height of 3 for BTC transactions and something around 10-20 for ETH, if not more.


I'm trying to visualize how sharding impacts it and now the introduction of staggering is making it even more complex to conceptualize...

5) on chain financial auditing
6) salaries paid as CBDC that automatically deduct tax disrupting payroll massively.

The list is endless it just needs the programmers to hook up with people from other industry to work together. So many disruptive opportunities it is ridiculous.

He discussed the potential of the network as a base layer for decentralized social media. He warned that complex yield farming and token-related activities could lead to financial instability and attract regulators' attention.

453	The rise of the Ethereum economy	1614731778.0	356	"I still don't get it. Why would anyone pay thousands of dollars for a token that proves nothing more than ownership of a hash associated with a work of art. If there was a legal framework to exercise this as copyright I'd get it, but there isn't. Anyone can use nyan cat without legal repercussions and the NFT owner has no legal means of defending his or her ownership.

It's a cool concept and I'm glad it's driving the adoption of Ethereum. But the tokens people pay absurd amounts of money for cannot possibly maintain that value after this hype ends.
I do feel there is a use case for NFTs that we haven't seen yet. Imagine it as a ""certificate of authenticity"". If it accompanied a rare piece of art, say, you could be SURE that you just bought a Jackson Pollock and not a counterfeit. In that case, it's not the actual NFT that is worth anything, but the ""certificate"" that accompanies it proving a provenance
Minting an NFT is about more than art. It‚Äôs about a verifiable asset purchase and transaction history. This provides provenance in a way previously very diffuser to achieve.

463	Vitalik Buterin: Moving beyond coin voting governance	1629100145.0	342	"The sad thing about this write-up / essay is that it shows how clueless the ETH developers are about economics, particularly in terms of how they think about collective action problems and public goods.

As any economics undergraduate should know -- public goods exist when -- despite the fact that overall welfare is maximized when we do Y --  everyone nonetheless does X because that is what maximizes INDIVIDUAL income regardless of what others do. Thus the tragedy of the commons where people put more sheep on the pasture because they are better off \*regardless\* of what others do. Or the free rider problem Vitalik is describing here where everyone mines / stakes rather than fund protocol upgrades because that maximizes my income regardless of what others do. Vitalik is missing something fundamental about economics and it is astonishing no-one is correcting him: people pursue INDIVIDUAL interests not GROUP interests. He is running into a public goods problem because his incentives are pointing to the wrong place.

So the source of this problem has NOTHING to do with  governance structures. His problem is not created by governance structures. And it is not solved by governance structures. All a governance structure can do is ADD MORE PROBLEMS -- by further distorting incentives and inducing more complicated ways for people to avoid spending money on Y. Making matters worse, ""governance"" structures necessarily require adding forms of closure (i.e. closed voting rings, etc.) which is pointless if one is supposed to be designing an open system (i.e. a PUBLIC blockchain).

The Ethereum Foundation has had so much money to throw at this problem it is astonishing that no-one there has bothered to pick up Mancur Olson and think about what their actual problem is. Because there is literally only one solution: figure out how to modify your consensus layer so that people are incentivized to do Y instead of X.
This is really well written.  We need strong leadership and I'm glad they recognize that even the best DeGov current systems are pale comparisons to a few good dedicated leaders.

Edit: I disagree with top post.  I think the understanding of the tragedy of the commons is well represented through the whole text.  There are inherent issues with all the presented strategies, otherwise they would be moving forward towards one of them.

edit: There were no comments 1  hour after this was posted.  I was surprised then at the lack of discussion.

There's no negotiation with this kind of play. There's no obligation to have anything signed and accepted. Just say no. And if they aren't listening, let them see how much they lose by losing you for countries who respect you better. Just like with employers, it's the only move that works."

477	High Gas Prices ‚õΩ Info & Resources	1614376651.0	329	"I read yet another mainstream media story today explaining how BTC is a Ponzi/bubble because it has no utility. Yet ETH has abundant utility and gas prices illustrate how much - a spectrum of truly decentralised applications with real use cases and real money being spent in fees.

Just wait until the mainstream media find out about it...
This is what happens when everyone has to compete head to head. If someone simply wants to send Ether to a friend, they have to compete with the arbitrage bots, investors, gamblers and others whose business model involves outbidding everyone else.

Part of the problem is also one of the blockchain's most important benefits - transparency. Arbitrage and gambling bots don't have to guess what's going to happen in the next block because they already know, and use that to their advantage -- and our expense.

So now it costs $5 to $10 just to do anything. A $5 Cryptokitty would cost around $10 to $15 after fees. It costs a couple hundred dollars to deploy a small contract.

It's hard to blame the bot developers, when there really is no law or set of rules to govern this. .. at least none that I know of. As it stands now, the solution probably requires change at some level. It will be difficult to change the EVM, so maybe smart contract logic can address it.

On the other hand, maybe this will start a boom in mining. As miners compete the price will go down.

Meanwhile as I type, the price of Ether is plunging so maybe that Cryptokitty just became a little cheaper.
So what are the actual limitations that prevent rising the block gas limit right now? This is a critical situation that is damaging to ETH reputation long term, wouldn't it be worth it to raise it to bridge the gap until rollups/L2 are deployed and adopted?

As far as I know, uncle rates are essentially at all time low, computation and storage is getting cheaper every day, what's the bottleneck here, are there any benchmarks showing that raising the limit would require too powerful and expensive hardware?

Let's start of easy with just 3 words. There are 2048^3 possibilities, about 8.6B possible combinations, but you check everything in 8.6 seconds.

Let's add another word, 2048^4. Now that is 17,592B possible combinations. But you are performing 1b calculations per second! So you crack that in 12.2 days.

At just 12 words there are so many combinations. 5.4E39 that it would take you 10,300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years for your 1b/s address checking computers to find an address.

We gotta stop calling the art piece the NFT like this, it makes it confusing.

It's like creating a piece of art and then saying ""Look at this deed I made!""

The NFT contract is the rights to the piece of art, but not the art itself.

Artists make art. Programmers make NFTs.

Much like how an artist makes art, and a lawyer makes a deed to said piece of art, typically.
I'm actually reading about this with comic artists and trying to understand this concept.  

Right now, I buy a piece of comic art and sell it to you.  I don't kick that back to the artist. At all. They really have no right (in my view) to any money since it's not their property.  It's mine.  I am not sure I like the concept of buying something from you and kicking back 15% when I sell it.

I know that this kind of exists in the blockchain world, but what right does my contractor (for example) have to any portion of the proceeds on my house when I sell it? Even if I have Martha Stewart herself design my house, she doesn't get any money if she does it for free or did it for a million dollars.  It's my property. I paid them to do their craft and they go away and leave me alone. 

This fundamentally goes against my understanding of property rights IMO.  Also, I am a private person, so what right does anyone have to know what I paid for something or who I am?  At any rate... I don't like this, but I may be in the minority.

I know Marvel artists started doing this a few weeks ago publicly and their works are sold from about 2-4 ETH on [portion.io](https://portion.io) . Without much fanfare, the art sold very quickly as I understand it. However, it's paired with the actual physical art and we're dealing with (in my view) a very interesting way to launder money out of the blockchain, hah.  

Other than a store of value (like gold) and a source of income for an individual in perpetuity, I don't see the value in tokenized art. Moreover, I could in fact just dodge the whole thing and just send my friend the token and exchange for money outside the system, which dodges your royalty.  

I suppose it would show as a sale for a very absurdly low price and devalue the token to a degree, but maybe the publicity is the defense.  I don't know.  All I know is that I probably will buy something to see where it goes and have it in my portfolio, but it's not my preference.  

IMO artists who create an NFT of comic art are attempting to have their cake and eat it too by eschewing original art / pencils / inks and benefiting from this digital world."

It‚Äôs an interesting idea but Harberger taxes will only work if there are no substitut without  Harberger taxes. Real estate at a precise location can not be substituted easily for someone working there thus it could work. If the most demanded artist start to make NFTs with Harberger I am ready to bet that a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù artist will take over him rapidly and his  Harberger NFTs will not be worth much.
> If you have an asset with a transfer fee, and you want to sell it, you simply transfer the asset to a wrapper contract.

I don't know why I didn't think of this before, but now it seems obvious.  This affects me since I'm playing around with a few different ideas for NFT's, none have transfer fees but one has tokens that enter a state where they can't be transferred at all, but now I realize the owner could do exactly that and easily get around it.  Doesn't kill my idea overall but it does eliminate a few what-if's I was thinking of.

> In a Harberger tax, the owner of the NFT or other asset sets a sale price for which anyone can buy the asset from them, and they get regularly taxed proportionally to that sale price

This is a super interesting idea, although I actually kind of agree with the podcast.  With the Harberger tax, it's up to you to decide how much you think your NFT is worth.  If you set it too high, you end up sitting on it and paying a lot of tax.  If you set it too low, then you'll probably sell it too quickly and miss out on profit.  The other model of depreciating licenses adds in an auction so that there can be some price exploration, although that makes more sense for things like spectrum licensing like they describe.

I wonder if there's a middle ground.  For example as an NFT owner, you get to set a price and periodically pay tax on the price, but the price immediately begins to depreciate on some fixed curve, and the tax you pay is actually based on the price at some point in the future.  That way you're still penalized for setting a very high price, but not quite as bad as before.  And now if the price is depreciating at a predictable rate, prospective buyers are kind of in an auction based on how impatient they are.

I guess this is why there are economists, since I'm just spitballing here and have no idea if there's weird catches/loopholes."

You use it to pay for dApps (gas) but you also use it to secure the network by depositing (staking) it and receive some in Eth in return.

Coming into this space the question is ""why do we even need eth if we have stablecoins"" but I think most long time crypto people realize why the heck do we need usd when we have Eth 

Look at the major erc 20 tokens vs now.  I think there will be high turnover for anything other than eth/btc
1. You need Eth to pay for transaction executed by Ethereum network, unfortunately no alter token for this payment so far.
2. You need Eth to stake to maintain Ethereum network(execution and security)
3. You need Eth to play with Defi, most of Defi apps needs to use Eth as collateral or using it as starting point to nurture Defi itself (exchange Eth to get native token, then liquidate Eth on market to get capital to build dApp...). This is trending, you can see it by taking a look at Uniswap or Sushiswap, pairs Eth/TokenX always are highest liquidity pool.

499	Why are the gas prices so high? Here's an infographic that explains what is actually happening with a TX behind the scenes.	1612342543.0	316	"This graphic explains the mechanics of adding transactions to a block, but doesn't really explain why the costs are high.

Basically there's a limited amount of transactions that can be added into a block because of fixed block sizes. When the network is 'congested' it means the pool of pending transactions is quite large and so users are outbidding themselves in terms of gas fees to be included in blocks faster, and other transactions stay in the pool longer.

Important sidenote: This is how the protocol works by design, not something miners have come up with, so congestion or high fees cannot be blamed on miners. It's just a limitation of eth until eth2 ships.
I'm posting this because a quick scroll of /r/ethereum shows like 15 different posts asking about gas price and this infographic has helped me explain the transaction process many times.

The short of it is that as adoption increases (or if some really hype project comes out and everyone tries to use it at once), the number of users sending transactions increases. The # of transactions that miners can confirm at a time is limited, so they prioritize the transactions with higher gas prices. This builds and builds and gas goes higher and higher.

Another factor is psychological. If your TX costs $5 in gas when ETH is $500, that same TX costs $15 in gas when ETH is $1500. The amount of ETH it requires is the same, but the value of that ETH goes up so it feels like it's way worse.

Layer 2 is on its way, thankfully, to help all of this.

It's interesting to see that the protocol has to be informed of real world issues and abuse attempts.

I can imagine there are so many of these decisions taken because they mitigate one or the other attack.
How does the core team taking care of the Ethereum protocol make sure that there are no regressions?

If Ethereum was a codebase and not a protocol I'd think automated testing would keep regressions away.

But being a protocol, automated testing doesn't apply.

Do tests get written in some (or all) implementations to check for these vulnerabilities? Or is it the sheer number of eyballs and brains focused at maintaining security of the blockchain responsible for catching problematic changes before they reach testnet/mainnet? If it is the latter I'm a bit afraid of the possibility of old attacks being possible again because the collective memory has faded, and people take for granted some countermeasures even when a change is introduced that removes such countermeasures.

Yup, everyone I've seen says that L2 isn't even here yet. Some are, and Optimistic Rollups (ORUs) are about a month away. ORUs seem to be gaining traction (to be the primary L2) given how easy they are (just use their compiler for your Solidity code), as well as big name projects like Synthetix, Uniswap, Chainlink, and Compound getting on board. These 2 things combined will create network effects to bring more projects into ORUs, so much so that in a short amount of time most users won't need to exit L2 and can stay there. At that point you only need to pay the onramp fee and you can sit on ORU and do everything there. A key inflection point here will be when Metamask, Coinbase, Argent, and Ledger support withdrawing to ORU.

511	One of my recent proposals for how to charge gas costs per code chunk accessed (to make statelessness viable once we add verkle trees)	1620701415.0	304	"I like your funny words magic man
So if I understand, the potential attack would be if someone uploaded a bunch of very large contracts (the max size allowed), and then began flooding a ton of transactions that only use a very small part of them, maximizing transactions per block.  In a future of stateless verification, the witness files needed to verify those blocks would have to include all the code of each unique(?) contract, going from normally a 1-3MB file to over 100MB.

So the plan is to logically split code into chunks, and only include chunks actually used in the witness, and charge a bit of gas per chunk so the gas cost of the transaction stays proportional to the size of the witness needed to verify it.

I'd definitely be interested to know how this would impact real-life transactions, both in terms of extra gas costs and on average what percentage of chunks a transaction accesses.  How many chunks would a typical ERC-20 transfer hit?  Maybe instead of a flat 350 fee, charge less for the first N and more for any after that, so that most reasonably small functions don't add a lot more gas?
ELI5:     
Normally in a Blockchain, to be able to verify that a block can be appended to it, you need to have a copy of the entire Blockchain, because the verification process jumps back and forth in the blockchain history to gather information to validate the changes.    

What if you could have all the information in a small package that's required to say ""yes, this can be added to the blockchain""?    

This is basically what this proposal is talking about, and this would allow smaller computers to be able to validate the new blocks without having massive amounts of storage."
512	I am still not sold on the value proposition of DeFi. 5 key criticisms.	1619620826.0	308	"It removes inefficiencies from using a middleman, like a bank or escrow.

Maker allows you to take a loan from yourself while maintaining exposure to your collateral asset. Just metamask, three clicks, and you got a loan. Now try that with a bank?

All the legal hassles from making sure all parties play by the rules are now reduced to a simple execution of smart contracts. Participants have no choice but to follow the rules.
All very good points. Let us consider the following cases:

1) the current entrenched systems favour the rich and powerful: it makes it easy to manipulate the supply of money by enriching the institutions by making everyone else poorer by printing money. Can they do that with ETH?
2) in the GME fiasco that is ongoing, shares can be counterfeited and printed by evil hedge funds. Can they do that with uniswap?
3) in all the past financial crisis: the large institutions fked up big time and the man on the streets took the brunt of it, whereas institutions got a bailout. If one day ethereum fks up some code or burns all our ETH, can we get a bailout? It‚Äôs fine if I don‚Äôt but at least now the field is levelled. It doesn‚Äôt care if you are rich and powerful to qualify for a bailout or not. 
4) money lent out to me in a bank, are they properly collateralised? How would you know? What about maker‚Äôs DAI? I can clearly see how much this money is collateralised. And clearly way lesser than most great financial institutions. 
5) is the stock exchange fair? Do you know about dark pools for trading? Are there dark pools for trading in the ethereum ecosystem? No? Everyone trades with the same exchange. No dirty tricks.
6) I almost forgot. Most importantly. When retail tiny guys on the streets are about to win, they removed the BUY button. Wow. In a DEX can someone stop you from buying something? No, you can always buy as long as there is liquidity. And there will always be true market forces at play. Not like the joke of the NYSE/NASDAQ. The big boys owns the casino. Not us.
You don't seem to think a totally free market is a good thing, I feel like you'd need to start there.

The other thing to consider is that crypto likely won't be used directly by most people, banks and financial institutions will act as interfaces to people's crypto, but the good thing is unlike the current system there will be a lower barrier to entry to become a financial service provider."

518	Some initial brainstorming on how we could increase address sizes	1615047042.0	301	"Interesting... the extra security seems like a huge win. I'll almost always prefer improved security over strict backwards compatibility.

Since the change seems to be driven by an increase in compute power, should it also include a mechanism for upgrading to 48/64 bit someday? (perhaps in a post-quantum future?)

It's always tempting to say ""oh that won't be a problem for XY years!"", but you never know what might happen.
I love everything about the new address, especially adding a version, except it still has one massive problem:

**Addresses need checksums.**

It is, in my opinion, one of Ethereum's largest design flaws.  [Bitcoin devotes ~~two~~ four whole bytes to checksums](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/32353/how-do-i-check-the-checksum-of-a-bitcoin-address), meaning only [1 out of ~~65,536~~ 4,294,967,296 errors make it through](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding#Creating_a_Base58Check_string).  

This isn't just a user or interface problem.  Computers [bit flip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_parity).  It's a huge security issue and there's a [market just for domains for bitflips](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/windows-com-bitsquatting-hack-can-wreak-unknown-havoc-on-pcs/).  ([Another link on the issue](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/08/10/bh-2011-bit-squatting-dns-hijacking-without-exploitation/)).  

If publishing addresses first was required, or there was some other protections, we wouldn't need checksums.  But there isn't.  Users can send precious ETH to addresses never seen before and Ethereum has no way to know what's valid.  This isn't a hypothetical, it's happened many times before. [One user famously sent a 5 figure sum](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4yru3h) to the ether (pun intended) 4 years ago.  That amount of Ether is easily worth USD 5 figures.  Like this user I too assumed Ethereum used checksums, like Bitcoin, when I first used it.  I was horrified to discover it didn't.  

Checksums inform Ethereum what's valid.  If we are going to update the address standard, addresses need checksums.

I'm glad to see so much activity in reddit from vitalik himself lately! 32 byte address seems the way to go now that we're seeing more and more computing power, it's sad because that I'm used to the 20 byte version but tech needs to adapt. Also I'm concerned about all the changes which are proposed and how all the status quo is being altered, and what precedent could mark to show people that their smart contracts functionality could change in a future (I'm talking about blockhash for executable beacon chain and the removal of gas refund opcodes)"

eToro is another one to watch out for. You can only deposit and withdraw USD, can't remove any actual crypto
You risk them being stolen on an exchange but you also risk (as a newbie) losing your keys to your wallet at which point they might as well be stolen. 

Frankly, keeping them on the exchange for newbies is probably better honestly. Simply because assuming the worst were to happen in either case. You have some hope that you‚Äôll be reimbursed. Unlike with withdrawing them and keeping them yourself, you‚Äôre just fucked otherwise. 

It boils down to risk tolerance and you should frankly be informed people of all the risks and benefits with each way to store their crypto. Neither side is risk free. One side just have some insurance behind it."

So yes like any opportunity on earth the wealthy have a significant advantage, but over the long term I see the systems favoring equality assuming they are built to. 

Cryptocurrency is also probably the only way we'll ever see a true global UBI. A few dollars a day won't mean much to someone in North America but would be absolutely life changing for a concerning amount of individuals globally.  Crypto is already going to bank the unbanked, that is just the beginning."

550	[AMA] We are the EF's Eth 2.0 Research Team (Pt. 5: 18 November, 2020)	1605579815.0	271	"Is there a plan B if 16,384 validators are not reached by November 24? A simple plan B is to change the *min\_genesis\_active\_validator\_count* to whatever validator number is present on November 24 to allow eth2 to start on 1st December.

I ask because the ETH economy has changed enormously since the planning of eth2 started with many options now available to obtain high yields from ETH. Today there is no logical reason to have a minimum of 16,384 validators as a requirement to start the eth2 chain. Game/economic/greed theory suggests that people will FOMO into something if there is a known financial reward greater than exists elsewhere. Furthermore, people get upset because of opportunity cost losses if they deposit ETH into a contract and it does not start producing rewards because the future start date of earning rewards is an unknown or individuals withhold depositing until a start date is known. Also, don‚Äôt forget about giving an advantage to POS competitors by delaying the eth2 launch.

&#x200B;

 Edit 18 Nov. 

It is now apparent that pool funds like Rocket Pool will not be able to send funds to the deposit contract until sometime in 2021 which excludes people with less than 32 ETH from participating in eth2 until contract interactions with the deposit contract are sorted. This may also be the case for other pool funds.

It would be great if the 16,384 validator number is achieved by November 24 as it has been a long hard road for the eth2 research team over the years and the eth2 client developers (with community help) and they deserve a successful genesis launch. However, nobody likes uncertainty and regardless of what plan B is it would be a very bad look if the EF does not articulate a plan B by November 24, better to be proactive rather than reactive. Imagine the coindesk headlines if there is silence.

eth1 genesis miner, participant in the early eth1 testnets and eth2 testnets, occasional bug submitter and irl R&D manager.  P.S. There was far greater risk in the early days with low miner numbers at eth1 genesis than with eth2 genesis especially as there are no transactions at phase 0.
Hey team, looking forward to mainnet, my ice breaker question:

I am sure Bitcoin is good investment as well but if you are beggining with crypto like me, maybe consider ETH to be your number 1 choice. Sure there is tiny chance something goes wrong with development and we get stuck but if not, I don't see how ETH would not be as valuable as Bitcoin. Even more.

I did a little bit of looking into it and found that the guy that authored the blog post is a Senior Developer at ConsenSys. He has a master's degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence. The blog post was also cross-posted to LinkedIn and Medium. 

So it doesn't look like he actually works for SAP but he is a ""Principal developer and hands on solution architect with 20 years experience designing and implementing enterprise solutions.

Binance and coinbase are big and trustworthy exchange but it can happen to anyone
A lot of people are going to tell you not to put your crypto on exchanges because ""not your keys, not your crypto."" However, Gemini and Coinbase now have a proven track record and these people are quick to disregard a few negatives about holding your own crypto. 1) You're holding your own crypto and you could lose your keys or get hacked yourself; 2) you could accidentally send your crypto to the wrong address or wrong smart contract etc; 3) You could miss opportunities to buy/sell by keeping your crypto off exchanges. For me, I think it's a personal choice and it's a balance between if/when you think you are going to sell/trade and how competent you are with your safeguarding your keys, and how much you trust yourself with basic crypto transactions.
Since you are planning to HODL, then one option is to store your coins on a hard wallet that‚Äôs kept in a bank safe deposit box."

To be clear, may of the dApps I used earlier today already can do 5K TPS, with the same level of security as mainnet (ZK-rollups). Moreover, some dApps can do 20K+ TPS today, but they use validium, so no on-chain data availability (but operator still can't steal money).

In short, Ethereum already scaled to significantly more bandwidth than we currently need. What we need now is for the ecosystem to move to L2, and make use of this bandwidth. This has already started, and is going to accelerate with ZK and optimistic rollup environments and bridges popping.

With PoS I believe you can choose what block time you want and as far as I know there is no random event so its always gonna be the block time you set. 

With this said you could target a lower block time with PoW if you'd like or 10 minute like Bitcoin is targeting. There are pros/cons to low/high block time, so lower doesn't necessarily mean better.
Nope this won‚Äôt speed up tx by itself. At least not greatly. There are two EIPs that could ease congestion by CEX and DEX tx, which would then also have the effect of improving time for a tx: 3074 and 2876. See also https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/simple-way-to-decrease-network-gas-usage/5524

598	ETH is completely unusable now -- fees	1612455959.0	236	"Many are trying to pretend this isn't a big deal. They will give us the technical reasons why the fees are so high. They want it to be a temporary hiccup that we should ignore.

Hell Fucking no, i can't move my damn money, i can't use ETH based apps, this is the entire reason to own ETH over BTC.

This is a huge fucking deal, and they aren't treating it as the huge clusterfuck that it is.

I'm pissed that my ETH is trapped and its been that way for weeks now.

To think that if this goes on much longer it won't affect price is putting your head in the sand. It does nothing to ignore the issue and pretend it will go away eventually.

Its happened many times in the past and it will continue to happen. Its a fatal flaw and it has to be fixed immediately.
It's a huge fucking deal.  It sucks tremendously.  I paid bid $93 in gas on a transaction and it's stuck in pending.  I have a loan that may get liquidated by volatility if I don't bite the bullet and drop $100+ on a single transaction.

As an investor I'm fucking pissed.  But as a software engineer I sympathize with the situation.  Every organization goes through scaling issues and growing pains.  Scaling to a global network of tens of millions of people is fucking hard even using traditional centralized server tech.

Imagine how difficult it is to scale up an experimental system based on theoretical computer science and math inventing totally new paradigms as you go with all your code out in the open for people to analyze for vulnerabilities.  Ethereum and smart contracts expose exponentially more attack surface then traditional web apps hidden in private networks behind firewalls and malicious attackers have enormous incentive to exploit any tiny vulnerability.

So building for blockchain is fucking hard, scary and you only get 1 chance to deploy to mainnet.  If most tech companies fuck up a deployment they can just roll it back.  Not so much with Blockchain.

Does this excuse development teams for not being prepared for scaling challenges?  No they must have to accept some of the blame.  Stop working on stupid fucking NFTs for a year and work on scaling solutions.

But Blockchain development is fucking difficult to get right and while I'm really pissed at the current situation, I'll begrudgingly choose security of the ecosystem over velocity if it really comes down to it.  But the need for scaling is URGENT.  The ETH Dev community should be LASER FOCUSED on scaling challenges instead of new features.  We need MORE developers in the space!  Try to learn to code if it's interesting to you there are lots of great resources.

I just try to look at the big fees I'm paying as the price of admission as an early adopter and I've made exponentially more in airdrops and earnings from DeFi then I've paid in fees.  So all things considered, I'm ahead.  Still sucks.  A lot.

The situation super sucks big time but we have to all contribute to the community however we can to move the ball forward.  Just my 2 gwei.

602	What is Layer 2? Confused	1617510971.0	237	">1. Why can you do a ""layer 2""? What does this mean? If something was built as a layer 2 on Ethereum, what are the restrictions for it? Why can't you do the same thing on Bitcoin?

Layer 2 is basically compressing a bunch of transactions and posting it to layer 1 Ethereum instead of processing each transaction on its own. (You can read more about layer 2s here: https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) 

Bitcoin doesn't have smart contract capabilities to enable rollups to function the way they do on Ethereum. Rollups inherit the security of Ethereum through data compression and then posting transaction changes onto Ethereum. 

> 2. I've heard some people (newbies) say that they should just make a smart contract layer 2 on bitcoin since it's more secure, so that we don't need to use Ethereum. Is this actually possible? I know that bitcoin can't handle smart contracts because it's not turing complete, what about a layer 2 on bitcoin? Do layer 2 solutions on bitcoin actually remove the purpose of Ethereum?

Vitalik Buterin actually proposed to enable smart contracts on Bitcoin but the Bitcoin devs rejected the proposal. They also later decided to limit Bitcoin to about 3 transactions per second. So, Ethereum emerged because Bitcoin devs rejected smart contracts and my impression is that the Bitcoin devs are not about to change their minds on these issues. 

At this stage, Ethereum has the lion's share of smart contract devs and it's unlikely for other protocols to overtake the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Many other blockchains (Polkadot, BSC, EOS and many others) have built bridges to Ethereum, thus further cementing the EVM's first mover advantage. 

> 3. I noticed that alot of dapps are going to be using layer 2 solutions, to get past the issue with transaction fees currently on Ethereum. Does this mean the existence of a dapp on layer 2 will not affect ethereum prices at all, and does not benefit ethereum? For example, if a dapp were on Ethereum, then there would be a large inflow of ethereum buyers increasing the demand for Ethereum. But dapps on layer 2 don't need ethereum tokens, there would be another token instead, so the users of such an app would not be buying Ethereum tokens.

As layer 2s and many other blockchains will be compatible with Ethereum and ERC20 tokens, this should increase the network effects of Ethereum (video on network effects https://youtu.be/Zb5kO8Pm6eg). 

Also, many layer 2s will be EVM compatible, which will allow dapps to interoperate with one another. I.e. I will be able to take my Eth on the Polygon chain and bridge it over to layer 1, xdai, arbitum or some other smart layer 2 chain quickly and cheaply. (video on Polygon aggregating layer 2 solutions: https://youtu.be/IijtdpAtOt0) 

> 4. For dapps that do run on Ethereum, after EIP1559 implements gas burning, wouldn't this mean that a ton of eth is going to be burned into nowhere from just dapp usage? This would raise the price of eth

In the future, Ethereum is likely going to become the settlement layer for many Ethereum layer 2 ecosystems. Very few dapps will run directly on Ethereum because it'll be unnecessarily expensive to do so. 

As for Eth getting burnt after EIP1559, this is the intent of the EIP to counter the narrative that Ethereum is not a store of value.

As you can see, Ethereum will probably become a deflationary currency and will be useful in a wide range of layer 2 ecosystems. I believe this will greatly increase the network effects of Ethereum.
Regarding Layer 1 vs Layer 2, one way to get an idea of it is to compare it with how gold was historically traded.

In the beginning, gold was traded as is, or in jewelry. It was cumbersome and if you wanted to trade just a little bit you would ""shave"" it and give just that.

At some point someone figured out - hey, why don't we store the gold/silver in a bank, and then create paper notes that are hard to forge and let people use that instead? If anyone wants to, they can at any time exchange their paper bills for the equivalent precious metal. The bills are much easier to transact, and you can easily turn them in for higher or lower denominations depending on your needs.

So paper bills were an L2 solution to L1(gold), until we ended up with today's fiat currencies.
I picture it like a tree and branches.  The trunk of a tree is strong and thick and gives you structure. But it has limited surface area. If you want to put leaves on your tree trunk, you won't be able to fit so many onto it without them getting in each other's way.

So trees grow branches and the leaves get moved onto those. All the resources the leaves generate get bundled together and sent back to the tree trunk via a comparatively small aperture where the branch meets the trunk.

Ethereum main chain is your stable structure, the side chains are your branches and your transactions are the leaves.  Instead of sticking all your transactions right to your main chain that has limited surface area, you can move them onto to the branching side chains. All the transactions from the side chains get bundled together and submitted in one go.  This way you get lots more room for dapps and transactions, but still enjoy the stability and structure of your main chain.

Also if one branch fails, the damage will likely be limited to only that one side chain. The main stem can focus on what it does best--security--and each branch can focus on what they do best--speed or scalability or price or whatever. And different branches can specialize and experiment in different ways without putting the trunk in any risk."
603	Now that's a lot of damage!	1598985440.0	234	"This is what is going to kill ETH if nothing is done about it very quickly.  


2.0 soon... yeah heard that song for 3 years now.
I'd like to reflect back on an earlier, more innocent time. The time was late to 2017 and the narrative was that Bitcoin was useless because it had $30 fees. 

Ethereum fanboys around the world laughed and mocked the stupid BTC protocol for being useless as a day-to-day currency like their beloved ethereum was, as fees were too high and the general public couldn't use it. 

Now that ETH has become that popular, the same thing is happening. We're hitting bottlenecks.

I'm not trying to start a war, merely pointing out the narrative shift from BTC being useless due to high fees, to ETH being popular because of high fees.
I literally sent over $10k in Eth last night for $5 & my Transaction Confirmed within a minute. 

Sure it‚Äôs expensive compared to a year ago but we‚Äôre in the beginning stages of an almighty bull run and the network has just birthed a never before seen tech in decentralised finance. It‚Äôs getting hammered as people‚Äôs curiosity bubbles over. 

We‚Äôre all here participating in a revolutionary shifting of the guards in relation to finance and technology. Yes there are scammers and high fees etc, there will always be negatives but just sit back and take a look at what is actually happening right now.. 

This shit is so fucking exciting!"
604	Am I dumbing this down correctly?	1622381315.0	236	"I think your explanation explains the ""world computer"" aspect of the currency, but not so much what the base level blockchain is. Blockchain is like every transaction all users watch and write down the transaction if it's valid. They all collectively agree what good and bad transactions are. Everyone  keeps a running Talley of balances for everyone, and keeps each other honest.
Man, your punctuation is wild.
Imagine block chain is an accountant writing down every single transaction that anyone can look at - except privacy coins which aren‚Äôt put on the books. 

The companies like polkadot, eth, etc are the company the accountant works for and only deals with those specific currency‚Äôs.

DAPPs are other business that have a deal with the accountants firm allowing the accountant to ledger their transactions under the dapps name.

The accountant will transfer, send, receive, pay and sell any crypto that they are allowed to deal with under your instruction and note it down making it publicly available.

Kind of this ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Edit: obviously each accountant and firm has strengths and weaknesses, some work quicker than others, or charge less, or don‚Äôt allow other companies (dapps) to work with them."

610	CNBC article on NFTs - 'It's like the early days of the internet'	1613275268.0	229	"I never got the draw to NFT's.  Why not make physical art with crypto embedded inside like a Ledger wallet?
Fuck CNBC.
 

I think people don't really get the point of NFTs yet. that's what makes them so undervalued. In 10 years or 20 years. all of those OG NFTs will be selling for millions if not more.

The biggest question we should ask ourselves isn't if the artwork can be copied. The artwork can always be copied. But one thing that can never be copied is the token itself, signed by the original author. Is the NFT a digital representation of the actual art OR is the art a representation of the NFT token? What is art? and why does it even have any value? I can tell you the value of the art does not simply stem from the artwork itself, but rather by the story behind it. The true art in its purest essence isn't the artwork or the thing that you can see or touch, but rather the ideas that it represents just like how we as humans aren't just our bodies but rather our consciousness as well.

In this way, NFTs capture the essence of art better than any other means imo. You can always copy any piece of art digital or virtual and you could probably even get an exactly replica of the mona lisa. But the NFT token itself stays forever (longer than a deBeers diamond). Even the artist cannot replicate that same NFT. Even if he reeditions the artwork years later, it won't be the same. It's kind of like an OG pair of AJ1 from 1985. There will never be one of those ever again. Wait until nostalgia starts to hit the culture. Man cryptokitties hype may soar again.

Remember, it's not the artwork itself, i.e. the thing you can see or feel or touch that is valuable but rather the idea of it and the story behind it.

Why is the mona lisa worth so much when I can get a replica that looks exactly the same? why is the price of a pair of OG AJ1 that MJ himself has worn be worth so much when you can get a new pair at the Nike Store for retail price (ok ok you can't anymore because of how hype AJ 1s are rn but they're still much less expensive on StockX than the OG ones)?

It's a matter of narratives and thinking? it's a philosophical question. Think about it. 10 years down the line, how will people look back at those?"

But essentially Ethereum is the trustless network on which applications (dApps) run. They run through a series of smart contracts coded into Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain. For instance, a developer can create a Smart Contract to handle Escrow accounts for real estate in a completely trustless manner, where no third party is responsible for verifying or approving a monetary transfer.

What sets Ethereum apart from Bitcoin is that it allows for these smart contracts. It has essentially made itself a trustless operating system. Bitcoin is simply a trustless ledger. So these applications are coded into Ethereum the same way a program is coded into IOS apps. Ethereum is the operating system on which applications are developed.

MIT License gives anyone the right to ""modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell"" ""without limitation"" -- so there is no permission needed, regardless of if some other document says nuh-uh.

EDIT 2: looks like they don't have to abide by the terms of the original MIT License because they aren't a licensee, they are the owners
It appears that MetaMask has resorted to [lying about re-licensing](https://archive.is/nSgU7#selection-1807.0-1807.37) existing code, either that or they don't understand what the term [re-licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_relicensing) means.

Since the Share-Alike clause prevents re-licensing the project the real license appears to actually be the original ""Ethereum Project Contributor Asset Distribution Terms ( MIT + Share-alike )"" license which would prevent this sort of re-licensing of the project to proprietary.
At some point it is sad, that metamask give such a huge adoption for Web3 than nothing else, and now they should seek after commercial users. While some shitcoins and scams are collected $100 millions.
I hoped there would be at least a permission to fork and distribute metamask if it's to be used with ethereum mainnet, but no. ""anticipated commercial application"" is really generic. Let's say someone adds a function for some specific dapp, that they earn money from, and distributes that. It would be commercial while still on ethereum.

I have a question about withdrawing when it is enabled.

Will it be able to partial withdraw e.g. withdraw profit and leave 32ETH for staking? I have heard that, the process is exit, withdraw and then make new validator with 32ETH. if so, the process is quite long and not  user friendly.
I have many questions! I'll try to, uhh, rollup multiple related questions into separate comments, so as to spam the thread with fewer comments. 

Here's the first batch, some numbers around data shards:

\- As per GitHub specs, 64 data shards are expected to offer a total of \~1.3 MB/s data availability. That's a lot, and comes up to \~600 GB/year/shard. How, when and if will the state size management techniques being developed for the execution engine be implemented for data shards?

\- The increase in data availability for shards is often cited as 23x (not sure what the original source is?) over the current execution chain, which is where the 100,000 TPS figure comes from. Looking through Etherscan, the execution chain seems to be more like 50 kB/block, which ends up at 300x, which seems to be an order of magnitude off. Obviously, I'm missing something here, can you explain the calculation behind this?

\- Either way, this is a massive increase! Why not be more incremental? Why was 64 shards and 248 kB chosen? Why not start with a potentially lower risk 16 shards and 100 kB which too is a massive upgrade?
Two questions

- Is there talks of potentially lowering the minimum ETH amount required to run a staking node after the merge? I get that when the 32 ETH limit was set, ETH was like $100-200, now after the shoot up in price, would it make sense to lower the amount required to like 2-4 ETH?

- Vitalik mentioned that Ethereum Sharding can easily expand past 64 shards, 64 is just the initial number you guys are working with. What's your vision on how much that number can be increased by, once the initial sharding is a success?"

Alright, as promised.  I'm truncating some of the quotes here for the sake of space, but in general I'll be replying to the entirety of each section.  I'll also be skipping some things since they're practically the same arguments and my post is already too long :(

> You can rent GPUs cheaply, <snip>

This is only true in the event that there's enough hashpower available to rent to perform the attack.  If it requires 1M GPUs to attack the network, but there are only 50k that are rentable, the cost to rent enough GPU is essentially infinite.  When dealing with quantities that are as large as the total hashrate for Ethereum, ""renting enough GPU to 51% attack the network"" is an impossible proposition from the start.  From this perspective the theoretical cost of a 51% attack is actually infinite.

> ASICs are a capital cost: <snip>

This kind of glosses over an important point: ASICs are bought once, but the time it takes to pay them off is usually pretty close to their useful lifespan.

This is also susceptible to the same problem as GPU renting: there simply aren't enough available to buy for the purposes of attacking the chain.

> Let's assume that a ~15% rate of return is enough to motivate people to stake (that is the expected eth2 rate of return). Then, $1 per day of rewards will attract 6.667 years' worth of returns in deposits, or $2433. <snip>

This math kind of doesn't make sense.  Returns should be measured in ETH, not in dollars; measuring a volatile asset in terms of expected return *in dollars* makes no sense, since the volatility alone dwarfs the rewards from staking (both in the positive and negative directions).

When you measure the returns in terms of ETH alone, the math stops working.  It's pretty hand-wavey when using dollars to begin with.

> It may even be the case that the public knowledge that all these coins are locked up causes the value of the coin to rise, so the total amount of money floating around in the community, ready to make productive investments etc, remains the same!

This entire statement makes no sense, and arrives at conclusions that are backwards.  For one thing, the assumption that the ""total money floating around remains the same"" is making some really weird assumptions about... basically every variable.  Also, the cost of the coins going up makes competition increasingly difficult over time, which is a net negative.  I don't even know what this section was going for, it was so hand-wavey.

> Note that there are two ways to use this 5-20x gain in security-per-cost. One is to keep block rewards the same but benefit from increased security. The other is to massively reduce block rewards (and hence the ""waste"" of the consensus mechanism) and keep the security level the same.

Ah here we go, now we get to the real reason why this change is so desired: we can spin reducing inflation as a ""good thing"", when the biggest beneficiaries of such a change are the largest holders.  Keep in mind that many of the largest holders were the largest holders in the presale (hmmmmmmmmm)

> In a proof of work system, if your chain gets 51% attacked, what do you even do? So far, the only response in practice has been ""wait it out until the attacker gets bored"". <snip>

This ignores a pretty big factor of 51% attacks on PoW chains: no one follows the security model.  Under the PoW security model, a transaction isn't secure ""after 6 confirmations"", it's secure when the hashpower required to double-spend it would be more profitably used mining honestly.  This means the number of confirmations is a function of transaction value, block reward, other transactions colocated in the block, and a couple other factors.  When transaction security is handled properly, 51% attacks become unprofitable by definition.  The only reason they tend to exist is because people take shortcuts by way of doing things like ""n confirmations"".

> In a GPU-based system, there is no defense, <snip>

This doesn't even make sense.  Changing the algorithm is still a viable option for GPU-mined PoW coins, because not all GPUs are equal or equally-proficient at various algorithms.  This sort of attack also still is subject to the same unreasonable constraints as any other 51% attack: it requires the availability of enough hashpower to rent in the first place.

> In the PoS case, however, things are much brighter. <snip>

This sort of builds a false equivalence between the kinds of attacks--and glosses over the difficulty of actually coordinating a community to activate a fork.  A fork to ""censor"" a group of ""malicious"" stakers would be as contentious (or more) than the DAO fork.  The DAO fork took weeks to implement and launch, and that says nothing about the community split that occurred.  This explanation sort of assumes that a malicious actor would be a black and white classification--but the reality (as we've readily seen) is far more shades of grey.  It undersells the difficulty of actually pulling this off, and assumes that such forks themselves are always ""righteous"" (i.e. cannot be weaponized themselves as an attack).  If a ""minority-activated soft fork"" is as trivial as is claimed, we should all be *very* concerned (especially by the word ""minority"").

> Proof of stake is more decentralized than ASICs

This is 100% false, *especially* on Ethereum. PoS can only be as decentralized as the wealth distribution of the staked token; and Ethereum's wealth distribution is utter garbage.  PoS is hands-down less decentralized than PoW on all accounts.

> This is also the correct answer to the common ""proof of stake means the rich get richer"" argument: ASIC mining also means the rich get richer, and that game is even more tilted in favor of the rich. At least in PoS the minimum needed to stake is quite low and within reach of many regular people.

This is especially worth calling out: ASIC mining means the rich get richer *but only in terms of off-chain wealth*.  ASIC miners in no way get richer in terms of on-chain wealth--they have to sell the majority of what they mine to cover costs and pay back capital investment.  And while the minimum needed to stake is ""quite low"", as vitalik said earlier, the idea is that the value of Ether goes up over time, which means staking will rise out of reach of more and more people.  As it does so, the gap between the wealthy and ""regular people"" increases proportionally.  This is bad for decentralization.

> Proof of stake is more like a ""closed system"", leading to higher wealth concentration over the long term

This is 100% true, and the justifications for it do not in any way outweigh the benefits of PoS (including the imaginary ones put forth regarding 51% attacks).  It doesn't matter how low the rewards are for staking: all fees go from the hands of regular uses to the hands of stakers, increasing the stakers' share of the total issuance and decreasing users.  If you believe in the naive ""supply and demand"" model for the costs of Ether, this is a vicious cycle: the more that is in the hands of stakers, the lower the supply for everyone else, increasing its demand and thus price.

> Proof of stake requires ""weak subjectivity"", proof of work does not

Cryptocurrency is supposed to be all about ""trust, but verify"".  Weak subjectivity requires trust, but does not provide a means for verification.

## Summary

So let's summarize:  PoS is more centralized, has greater centralization pressures, and, when coupled with deflationary (or minimally-inflationary) economic models, these combine to create a vicious cycle in favor of stakers accumulating wealth (and therefore power) over time.  PoS on Ethereum is incredible biased towards early movers, due to the differences in capital required to ""buy into"" the staking set, and given the lack of transparency into the crowdsale, is unknowably centralized to start.  PoS' economic incentives (if you believe in the naive ""supply and demand"" model) are structured such that the earlier you acquired Ether, the greater your relative incumbent advantage against parties trying to join the staking set. PoS creates a world in which the oligarchs you have at the start of the system are the oligarchs you will have *forever*, because the economic incentives are biased towards their accrual of wealth, which raises the barrier to entry for any new participants over time, while simultaneously increasing the incumbents' wealth.  As the availability of Ether goes down, the price is expected to go up, which not only increases the wealth of the largest holders, it makes it harder for anyone to challenge their control.

Furthermore, if there already exists some party that controls a majority of the staking set, it will be impossible to remove them at all.  Under PoW, even if someone controls 100% of the hashpower, someone with enough capital can create their own hashpower and begin to compete with them. ""Total hashpower"" is, practically-speaking, unbounded.  You can always add more, and thus dilute someone else's share (in addition to your own).  PoS, under a deflationary model, creates a ""hard cap"" on total issuance, which means the total *available* stake is finite, creating conditions in which someone who acquires (or holds) a majority of it cannot be removed.  If someone owns 51% of the total issuance, it's game over.  There's only 49% left."

Not only are there a ton of scams but many also lose money because they send a transaction to the wrong address or lose their keys.

If you think about it this is basically the Nigerian prince scam 3.0. An anonymous person sitting in some random place around the world asks you to send them money so you can get more money back. The only difference is they're using crypto instead of Western Union, which is even safer and more convenient for the scammers.

Gaming has never been the sole use case for dedicated GPUs and the only reason their development became gaming-oriented is due to market demand for entertainment.

Or at least, you don't seem to recognize the sheer number of generally unreasonable assumptions you'd need to make to *make* it calculable.

Take for a second the idea that someone would be starting from scratch - zero hash rate. How would they expand their hash rate? Well they *could* buy the hardware, but think about the volume of cards they'd need to buy. For the same reason that the cost of GPUs has skyrocketed as mining profitability has increased, the cost of GPUs in this scenario skyrockets too. There's no flat cost per MH/s you can calculate, because it skyrockets the second someone is introducing the same volume of demand as *half* of the entire hashrate that currently exists. You can argue they might instead buy hash power through something like NiceHash - but the cost per MH/s on that platform too would skyrocket, and the marginal MH/s you buy costs exponentially more over time.

It's not a simple value to calculate because the price of it changes so much as the attack proceeds. You can kind of make a best guess as to how cost increases as demand increases, but we don't have good data for that to make evidence-based approximations (especially in such extreme circumstances). It'd be a bad model and a bad estimate, there's no way around it. So then what have we gotten with all of that effort?

686	How is Proof of Stake supposed to combat centralization?	1611292294.0	188	"There is no perfect solution. If there were, we‚Äôd be using it. PoW has the benefit that it‚Äôs conceptually simple, easy to code, and it‚Äôs immediately obvious it works because it can‚Äôt be reversed. Now long term there is centralization issues that are easy to foresee. Moreover, since essentially PoW becomes a game of trading electricity (proved costs) for crypto‚Äôs, you can expect a geographical centralization (where electricity is cheap) on top of economies of scale leading to centralization.

Now, with PoS, there‚Äôs multiple benefits beyond avoiding burning electricity and allowing consistent&small block intervals. Most critically, it specifically penalizes attempts at trying to overthrow the system. With PoW, attempts to double spend are calculatable costs, you can statistically work out a model where it becomes beneficial to pay for a re-org and force a double spend. Yes, I‚Äôm talking specifically sending say 1 billion in BTC, then pay for mining a side chain, wait until the 6 confirmations are in, then make your mined blocks public (which obviously have to be further ahead than the main chain). You may think this is unrealistic, but you asked what benefits pos have over PoW. In PoS, doing that attack is a predictable cost. And yes, doing such a double spend would likely tank the crypto‚Äôs worth/confidence, same with PoS. In PoS, if you try to do that and you fail, the costs are much, much higher, cuz now you lost all your stake. Which is kind of the whole point.

And then there‚Äôs the economies of scale. When people talk PoW centralization, essentially it‚Äôs a side effect from economies of scale. There are no economies of scale to be had with PoS. Ergo, the whole centralization argument doesn‚Äôt make sense in PoS.

Now that doesn‚Äôt mean that PoS is safe from attacks. As I said originally, no system is perfect. If 51% of your country‚Äôs population decide that the country should be abolished, it‚Äôs gonna be really hard to argue against it because ultimately it kind of is what the people want. Point is, PoS isn‚Äôt perfect in every way ‚Äî it wont stop a double spend if the majority of people are for it (or 66%, depends on PoS model). And yes, I know that 1x PoS crypto isn‚Äôt ‚Äúone person‚Äù as far as voting goes, but then again, that‚Äôs where the cookie crumbles.

PoS does an honest attempt at making it expensive attacking it, and has no economies of scale centralization parallel.
Simple answer is: anyone can stake ETH, whereas only persons/companies with specialized skill and equipment can mine a POW chain.  POS therefore opens up the ability to participate in consensus by pretty much anyone anywhere in the world, which increases decentralization.
I‚Äôll try to keep this simple.

Let‚Äôs take the example of Bitcoin for proof of work.  At the start, anyone with a computer could participate and mine on their laptop.  Then it became lucrative and people started buying GPUs (graphics cards) because they could mine faster and make more money and it was definitely enough to cover the cost of a GPU.   But the way proof of work works is that the *first person* to solve the proof of work gets the Bitcoin reward.  So people without GPUs started to slowly make less money.  And the people with more GPUs made more.  Eventually if you didn‚Äôt have enough GPUs you would make less because the person with more would statistically solve the proof of work first more often than not.  What you have at this point is a bit of a arms race.  The more money you spend on hardware, the more money you make and if you don‚Äôt continue to spend more, your existing hardware investment because worthless.  Because it is winner take all, you are engaged in an arms race and like you said, most capital wins.  

This went on and on and instead of GPUs, people started using specially designed chips to mine Bitcoin called ASICs.  At this point, you need hundreds of millions of dollars and you need to have access to manufacture these custom ASICs.  Long story short, most of these mining farms are concentrated in China now. 

So centralization here can mean a couple things:
1) the winner take all dynamic leads to a centralization tendency.  You are the winner or you are the loser.  
2) that leads one country having a large say over Bitcoin which is a central point of failure. If for some reason, a few of those miners decide they want to screw Bitcoin, they have a decent shot at it. 

Proof of stake solves a couple of things. 
1) more people can run it with fairly basic hardware; if there are 10s of big btc miners, there are probably thousands of individual ETH stakers .  Not amazing but definitely better. 
2) every validator has the same likelihood to propose a block meaning it isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúwinner take all‚Äù and a lot of income is earned from attesting which rewards consistent validating over time, which means even less winner take all
3) you still have to be fairly rich to be a staker, but you aren‚Äôt making specialized hardware.  Again; not perfect but definitely more attainable.  Comparing 10s to 1000s is a good way to quantify the level of decentralization and that‚Äôs probably the best way to answer such a question.  Using words like centralized and decentralized aren‚Äôt as helpful because those are theoretical ideals.  It is probably better to just say proof of stake is less centralized than proof of work.  How much less?  Well how many ppl have to decide to say fuck ETH 2.0 to take it down?  Is it more than BTC?  Then it is more decentralized. 
4) an important detail with proof of work, you can imagine scenarios where China might say, fuck it I don‚Äôt like btc and try to destroy the network.  They‚Äôll lose their 100s of millions in hardware costs.  But let‚Äôs say China says screw ethereum 2.0, they‚Äôd literally have to buy a bunch of ETH first, try to destroy the network and at the same time, destroy the value of the ETH they just bought to stake.  It would take a lot more to harm the network.  This isn‚Äôt centralization related but it shows proof of stake is overall more secure, not just from centralization threats.  This kinda address the problem of one big rich person trying to take over the network."

I need to pay legit 35-40 dollars to interact with the compound smart contract. This is not feasible at all. 
People start getting into crypto with low amounts, 50 bucks or a hundred, maybe two. Very few of the normal dudes out there decide to put all their savings into one transaction. 

And even then: for compound or any other defi Dapp you in most cases need to interact with the smart contract several times. This is extremely expensive compared to a 'normal' transaction because of the many changes to the EVM that need to happen when execution the functions of a smart contract. 

It is just not feasible to pay 40 bucks just to put some money into, get some money out of or change a setting on your Defi Dapp. 

Yes, people are coming in because of negative interest rates, because of the volatility and the high prices right now. 

But the high transaction fees are a flaw on the road to adoption, not a bonus. Yes, you may argue that the gas fees are high because of high prices and lots of people buying it. 
But don't confuse cause and correlation. 

The fees are high, because of a lot of traffic and because of high fiat conversion rate. Both of the latter are good for adoption.

He‚Äôs talking from a monetary/asset perspective. 

Bitcoin is far superior than Ethereum for that. 

People always talk about Bitcoin being the Gold and ETH the fuel.
As an investor, I look at it in a similar fashion... 

Gold- doesn't have much functionality, but is nice to look at around someone's finger/wrist/neck and seems to be the ""go-to"" as a currency substitute. Limited supply, with a steady demand based on perception 

Oil- is a major component of functional infrastructure (fuel) AND is used to create many physical products. Easier to accumulate. Value based on economic needs and costs, as well as supply/demand.

In the real world both are valuable and worth holding as a portion of your portfolio, but also have risks. 

Same goes for BTC and ETH. They really are designed to do different (yet similar) functions. Just because ETH has more functionality, doesn't mean it's an overall better investment. 

But in my opinion, you should HODL both!

Lol. Especially with all the utility for NFTs. There is a ton of garbage out there but more than enough legit projects. I‚Äôve made more money in NFTs than any other crypto, hell, I just received 5 ETH for free JUST for participating in the NFT space early on. You haters are seriously missing out.
If they are then it‚Äôs just transfer of wealth from stupid people to less stupid people.
I've been in the NFT space for 2+ years, running flowerpatch.app

Some things of note about this scene lately:

 * A year ago, the user numbers were truly tiny. We did analysis on OpenSea's entire userbase, and found only 6000 accounts that were active and kinda valuable - of the 20k that were using OpenSea at the time. Since then, I think there really has been big growth, but the community is still reasonably small
 * The explosion of Rarible (NFT art) has been interesting. Aside from having their own exchange, Rarible is also the top token on OpenSea right now. I definitely think this is an exciting development, but also want to take a step back. Digital art scarcity only matters if people care. Like ""wowo you really have an original run banksy"" ‚Äî there needs to be places where such art can be viewed. This is where cryptovoxels and decentraland have found a substantial niche - as showcases and digital galleries. That's half of what makes Rarible work ultimately
* Though I should also note, there are some people who think that like in real art, money laundry is a major issue. ""Oh? Bitcoins from 2012? Nah, I lost all that trading art that didn't end up having any value"". Digital art + crypto has upgraded some old methods
 * Obviously a big reason that NFT is blowing up now is the intersection of NFT and DeFi. Projects have started coming up where you can stake NFTs to earn ERC20s, or other NFTs. Then they usually have some method of incentivizing people to put money into uniswap pools, to reinforce their new token. Flowerpatch has dipped its toes in this as well, where harvesting our FLOWERs in-game generates layer 2 SEED tokens
* However, this ""NFTFi"" craze has a fair bit of the scammy hallmark of the yield farming craze. Many projects are coming up that have no intention of being more than a pump and dump with some fancy new tokenomics designed to pump based on hype. This is definitely less ideal, pretty degen stuff. But tbh there is good money to be made pumping one project after another, so people do. If you know about all the pumps, you can probably earn 0.5-1 eth per project just from airdrops and flash hype
 * Many projects I am friends with are actively working on layer2. Our scene was really hurt by the gas fees. Flowerpatch lost money for 4 months this year. I believe that Matic layer 2 has come out far ahead in crypto gaming. They are giving out 50k/month to projects, have working tech, provide lots of support. The next phase of crypto gaming will be really fast, cheap, user friendly. Some games, like ours, will make it so transparent that non-crypto users can be onboarded quickly and easily
 * Though in a funny twist, OpenSea is now doing record volume. It seems like people are willing to value NFTs even higher than before, and pay the fees. But the aforementioned money laundry (and wash trading) may also play a role...

Anyway, so it's clear that NFT is going to be just as important as ERC20! The ecosystem is maturing fast, and bearing fruit. Bless"

711	Ethereum 2.0 (ETH) vs Cardano (ADA) vs Algorand (ALGO)	1613660290.0	182	"I belive Ethereum will keep 90%+ of the market while the rest of the market fights for the last 10%.

Ethereum is the most battletested smart contract chain with the most development being done on it, it also has the highest focus on decentralization. The reason Ethereum hasn't really scaled yet is that they are focusing on everyday people being able to stake from a computer they can afford to buy. 

Ethereum 2.0 will be a proper proof of stake system, they are building it with the mindset that people are greedy, not all people are but when you have a open decentralized system without any gatekeeping you need to design it so that the motivations of the greediest people in the world is aligned with the common good of the ecosystem. This is why you need to lock your eth when staking on the Ethereum blockchain you need to be delayed so that you cant attack the chain and jump out before you suffer the consequence. In addition to the lockup time there is a slashing mechanism that lets slashers police the chain and punish people that have provably done something that goes against the good of the network. This is one of the points Cardano fails at the only motivation to do what is good for the chain is that you loose what you would have earned, your initial investment is safe and there is no lockup time so you can execute an attack and jump out before the community and the price has time to react.

Another feature of cardano is that they vote on the transaction fee instead of letting the market discover it which hinders some financial applications that are relying on getting into the next block and might cause huge cues if the chain really gets going, since the voters wont be able to keep up with the fluctuating demand. 

While the Ethereum developers are developing Ethereum to be a stake at home friendly system the Cardano devs are developing cardano with the mindset that professional admins are needed to run a validator properly I belive this attitude will cause the computational requirements of running a Cardano node to increase to the point where you need a really expensive complex setup to run one effectively if Cardano become as popular as Ethereum is now.
Personally just from an ease of use standpoint Algorand is the clear winner right now. If the purpose is to use the platform and its token, Algo is winning. Ada almost has a cult like following and seems to scoff at the idea of coinbase adoption. Most people already don‚Äôt know two shits about crypto, but if they‚Äôre going to try to get into it, it needs to be easy and it needs to make sense. Algorand has a native wallet, trades on coinbase, takes like a second and less than .001 Algo to transact. Anyway, could be were looking at this thing all wrong. It‚Äôs likely that this isn‚Äôt even a whose gonna win whose gonna lose type situation but rather who will be used for what and how much of the market they control.

TLDR: there won‚Äôt be one coin to rule them all.
Dont expect to get an unbiased opinion and prepare to be downvoted in this sub if you're making valid points as current coin holders, stakers, and node validators in cardano, polkadot, cosmos, and algorand

Theres plenty of room for value to grow in crypto and the winners wont be determined for a long time. Competition is really good for this space, think car companies all being able to compete with each other and arent doing too shabby. Apple and microsoft, etc, theres plenty of room for growth between competitors and theres room for growth for partnerships and working together. The winner takes all mentality comes from people highly invested in one platform causing them to desperately want only their investment to grow."

729	Ethereum Scalability Race - April 2021 update	1617551775.0	174	"I don't think we're ever going to see one solution prevail. In fact, I agree with you about the hybrid approach. Something that allows devs to utilize the tech they need depending on the project. Despite your advice to polygon to abandon  it's kitchen sink approach, I think their approach is the most helpful. It would combine all of these solutions in a manner where they are not siloed and devs can move from one to the other when necessary. 

Not to mention, their SDK program is allowing devs the modular and extensible framework for building Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Imo, I think they're gonna come out ahead of the pack, as suggested by the crowds running to implement them, especially when they come out with optimism/zk roll ups. I'm not sure any other L2 solution is more loyal to ETH or has done more to advance ETHs dominance and ensure it's success, which we all know is threatened by high gas fees.
Thank you for the writeup. I know very little about scalability besides some basic common knowledge about Loopring, zkSync, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon. From the little I gathered reading / watching about Polygon/MATIC I have become a big fan of their efforts. They seem to have the right mindset to become a dominant force.

It is brilliant to see several projects offering scalability solution and pushing Ethereum to new TPS levels. Thank you for improving my knowledge on the subject.

We can save more and our security and privacy are safe from any malicious attacks. I'll try to invest to Lif tokens and I think it is guaranteed that I really can trust this."
734	Upgrade your node. Only 64% are up to date. 2 days left.	1627973224.0	172	"What will happen if not enough people upgrade. Will it be unstable? Is this a chance to manipulate the price of ethereum since there are not enough nodes to run it? What is the minimum of upgrade nodes needed to declare the 4th of August as successful switch?  


Sorry for maybe stupid questions :)
For this particular release, it may not be as bad as it looks.

I'm assuming that they count Geth v1.10.6 as ready and Geth v1.10.5 as not ready (likewise with Erigon and Nethermind versions before the recent consensus issue).

But the consensus issue that came up last week was sort of a ""soft"" consensus issue. Geth v1.10.5 would accept blocks that Geth v1.10.6 considered invalid, but there are no blocks that Geth v1.10.6 will produce that Geth v1.10.5 would consider invalid. Thus, if you're running Geth v1.10.5 **and not mining**, you're very unlikely to have an issue with this. So long as the majority of the network's hashing power are mining with the corrected consensus rules, the nodes with the incorrect consensus rules will stay on the correct chain. You could go back as far as v1.10.4 with the `--london-override` flag and come through the hard fork just fine, so long as the majority of hashing power is on the right side.

That's not to say you shouldn't try to update to v1.10.6 in time for the hard fork, but if you're on v1.10.5 or even v1.10.4 with the `--london-override` flag set correctly, you'll most likely be fine.
I would just add that as a solo staker, I was ""smart"" enough to upgrade geth and prysm in advance of the upgrade.  It was in my calendar, and did it ""last week"".

However I saw a similar post a couple days ago and double checked - and my geth was on 1.10.5 (which was current ""last week""/12 days ago).  I forget when I did it, but I suspect the ubuntu repository was not updated until last week.

So worth checking your versions, even if you think you were being practical like I was!"

744	Earn Staking Rewards and Support the Upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 on Kraken	1607028533.0	167	"Kraken is excited to announce that clients can stake their Ethereum (ETH) on Kraken to receive rewards of approximately **5% to 17%.** The network reward is variable and 17% is currently the highest possible yearly yield.

**ETH staking launches Friday December 4 at approximately 13:30 UTC.**

Staking is enabled on the Ethereum network as part of the first phase of a major upgrade called Ethereum 2.0 that is expected to greatly improve the speed, scalability, security and efficiency of the network.

### Benefits of staking ETH with Kraken

* Receive variable staking rewards of approximately **5% to 17%** yearly, based on the network rate
* Receive rewards every week
* Stake small or large amounts ‚Äì with Kraken you can stake less than the 32 ETH minimum required on the network
* Help support the upgrade to Ethereum 2.0
* **Coming soon:** Trade staked ETH for unstaked ETH (market will not be available for clients in the US and Canada)

### Staking is primarily for long-term ETH holders

Clients should be aware that **staked ETH cannot be unstaked, and along with staking rewards, cannot be transferred for an unknown period of time**. This means that clients should only stake ETH that they plan to hold long-term. This limitation is not specific to Kraken ‚Äì it is a limitation on the Ethereum network itself.¬†

**Coming soon:** As a courtesy to clients who may wish to exchange their staked ETH for unstaked ETH, Kraken will provide a special trading pair for this purpose until the ability to unstake ETH is available on the Ethereum network. We expect to launch this trading pair in approximately one week.¬†¬†

**Two important caveats about the market to exchange staked ETH for unstaked ETH:**¬†

1. **The market will NOT be available for users located in or residents or citizens of the US and Canada (these clients can stake ETH, but not trade their staked ETH for unstaked ETH)**
2. **We offer no guarantees of any kind about the continued availability or liquidity of this market ‚Äì price slippage in market orders should be expected and it may be difficult to exchange staked ETH for unstaked ETH in large amounts or at all, and this market may not be available for the duration of the Ethereum 2.0 transition**

### More about Ethereum 2.0 and staking

When the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is complete, it is expected that the network will be able to process thousands of transactions per second, a huge leap forward in network speed.¬†

There are two major technical elements in the upgrade. The first is a transition from a proof of work (POW) consensus model to proof of stake (POS). In the early stage of the transition, Ethereum will have both POW and POS chains.¬†

The second element is the introduction of ‚Äúshard chains,‚Äù which are an interconnected set of POS chains that will share the load of the network. Shard chains are somewhat like the blockchain version of parallel processing, or having multiple CPU cores in a computer.¬†

The upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to proceed in four stages. The first stage of the upgrade, called ‚ÄúPhase 0,‚Äù introduces proof of stake to the network with a special chain called the Beacon Chain. The Beacon Chain will play an important managerial role in Ethereum 2.0, by coordinating stakers in the network and keeping shard chains secure and in sync.¬†

Clients who stake ETH in Phase 0 are not only eligible to benefit from staking rewards, but also provide a valuable public service by helping to secure the Beacon Chain, which is the foundation for the later stages of the upgrade.¬†

The original Ethereum 1.0 proof of work chain is expected to continue to exist and operate normally until the third phase, called ‚ÄúPhase 1.5,‚Äù when it is expected to transition to a proof of stake shard chain on Ethereum 2.0.¬†

The ability to unstake ETH on the network is not expected to be available until Phase 1.5. It is unknown if or when exactly Phase 1.5 will launch.¬†

### Symbols and trading pairs

During the transition to Ethereum 2.0, Kraken will use different symbols to represent Ethereum tokens that have a different status on our platform and the network.¬†¬†

* **ETH:** The symbol ‚ÄúETH‚Äù will represent tokens on the original Ethereum 1.0 chain. ETH will continue to be traded under our existing trading pairs and can be deposited or withdrawn as before.
* **ETH2.S:** The symbol ‚ÄúETH2.S‚Äù will represent staked Ethereum tokens on Ethereum 2.0. ETH2.S cannot be deposited or withdrawn. ETH2.S can be traded for ETH, however this market will not be available for residents or citizens of the US and Canada.
* **ETH2:** The symbol ‚ÄúETH2‚Äù will represent Ethereum tokens received as staking rewards on Ethereum 2.0. ETH2 cannot be deposited, withdrawn or traded.¬†

**Coming soon:** Kraken will also offer a special trading pair during the transition to exchange ETH2.S for ETH (expected to launch in approximately one week).¬†

* **ETH2.S/ETH**

**Two important caveats about the ETH2.S/ETH trading pair (again):**¬†

* **This pair is NOT be available for residents or citizens of the US and Canada (these clients can stake ETH, but not trade ETH2.S for ETH)**
* **We offer no guarantees of any kind about the continued availability or liquidity of this pair ‚Äì price slippage in market orders should be expected and it may be difficult to exchange staked ETH for unstaked ETH in large amounts or at all, and this market may not be available for the duration of the Ethereum 2.0 transition**

Note that ETH, ETH2.S and ETH2 are all tokens of the same asset and are only being distinguished because different tokens can have a different status during the transition to Ethereum 2.0.¬†

Although ETH2.S and ETH represent the same asset, the ETH2.S/ETH trading pair will be an open market. ETH2.S may generally trade at a discount to ETH, since clients will have the alternative to directly stake their ETH to ETH2.S, at a 1:1 ratio.¬†¬†

### How do I stake ETH to Ethereum 2.0?

1. First you will need ETH in your Kraken account
2. Navigate to ‚ÄúStaking‚Äù > Select Ethereum  

3. Read and agree to the disclaimer, then select ‚ÄúStake‚Äù¬†

### When will my staking rewards begin?

The network has a limit on the number of new validators that can be accepted each day. Because of this, we estimate that it may take a week or more to start earning full rewards after you stake your ETH.¬†¬†

### I‚Äôm not interested in staking my Ethereum tokens at this time ‚Äì is there anything I need to do to prepare for Ethereum 2.0?

No ‚Äì you do not need to do anything. You can continue to hold your ETH on Kraken or in a private wallet and deposit, withdraw and trade as normal. When Phase 1.5 launches, your ETH will transition over to the Ethereum 2.0 network.¬†

### What if the Ethereum 1.0 chain forks?

Any ETH tokens that you stake during the Ethereum 2.0 transition will no longer be accessible on the Ethereum 1.0 chain. This means that if the Ethereum 1.0 chain forks, you will not receive forked tokens for staked Ethereum tokens. If Kraken were to support this hypothetical fork, you would only receive the forked tokens corresponding to your ETH balance. You would not receive any forked tokens for your ETH2.S or ETH2 balance.
There‚Äôs no mention of the % cut Kraken will take from staking.

EDIT: u/Kraken-Christian mentioned below that 15% was not mentioned anywhere. All Kraken has stated thus far is that an administrative feee will be taken, but there is no clear indication of what that fee is.

-	Is staking my ETH (essentially trading my ETH for ETH2S at a 1:1) a taxable event for US citizens? Sounds like it possibly could be."

Solidity dev here

I‚Äôd bet my house they will decrease time under 2%

This is intended and ideal. The debt inflation of those holding without staking is the reward the stakers receive.

I'm incredibly interested to know if popular NFT's minted now will become legendary items in 2030 or so. Will cryptopunks sell for 10000 ETH each? If indeed that is the future, if an NFT you buy now for 1 ETH at today's value is worth 100 ETH in 2030 value, who knows how much a single NFT could be worth?

Because if that's the case (and we don't know if that's the case; who knows the future?), then NFT's could right now be one of the greatest investments that nobody is really thinking about.

If you can display NFT's in virtual realities a decade for now and people can see what year they were minted and their value keeps rising (again, I don't know!)... game over man... the people with the old, valuable NFT's are gonna be the new digital oil barons.

I'm starting to think that these NFT's being bought for >10 ETH aren't such a wild purchase after all. Buy for $17500 today, sell for a MILLION in 2025-2030. And the things have intrinsic value to the human spirit, so even if you don't make a MASSIVE profit you still have something that is yours.

Even someone with not a lot of ETH who is just mining casually on a gaming computer with his RTX 3070 or whatever will eventually reach 0.10 ETH. Imagine someone invests in precisely the right NFT, waits ten years, sells for half a million.

767	Ethereum 1559 community call	1612880008.0	161	"There is a lot of competition coming after Ethereum, we have to think about it‚Äôs long term success. I know miners are making a killing right now, but these high fees are hurting Ethereum‚Äôs ability to blow away the competition. If we can be a world computer and a deflationary asset, we will be set up for extreme success.
While I feel that it is commendable to hear the miners, I fear that nothing good will come of this. There is a very vocal faction that does not care about Ethereum and only for their own short term gain. They will fight dirty to get their will without any consideration for the userbase.

The community should start organizing to bring online a lot of hashpower for the time of a likely contentious fork. The contention is mostly between a bunch of commercial miners and pretty much the rest of the ecosystem.

768	Is it worth staking 1-2 ETH into the staking pools?	1608565960.0	160	"Not a silly question. In my opinion, it really depends on your time horizon. If you don't plan to sell for a few years, why not? Even if you're only raking in .08 ETH per year (2 ETH x 5% staking rewards, less 20% admin fee - to be extremely conservative). It's better then not staking and getting 0 ETH. Hell, if ETH one day gets to $10k ETH (god almighty I pray to the ETH lords every day), then you'd be looking at $800 per year.... for doing nothing. All depends on time horizon though.
[deleted]
I personally had this same thought process and my take was to take a pass as it's a bit of a new horizon for ETH 2.0. 

I have 4 ETH and chose to split it between Celcius and Blockfi. 

Celcius has and APY of 5.5% paid in ETH weekly

As for Blockfi it's APY is 5.25% paid monthly but (interesting bit here) you can chose the FLEX option for the accurred interest to be paid in another coin, in my case Bitcoin.

This of course has a down side of immediate tax obligations but i weighed it against my risk tolerance and wanted something of a better known realization."

772	I'm extremely hesitant to stake my Ethereum	1605120006.0	164	"[deleted]
Staking Eth isn't about it being the best way to make money. It's about your belief in the future of the ecosystem and showing your willingness to support it. As a perk you get rewarded a bit for your efforts. If this resonates with you then stake. If not, noone is forcing you to do so.
> I can't justify staking ETH toward the beginning of a bull run

Many of us own a lot more than 32 Ether... so staking is just a fraction of our portfolio that was intended to hold long term at the end of the day. Also, ""long term funds"" would never be gambled in an effort to ""time the top"" of a bullrun & buy back lower to begin with... which is statistically difficult."
773	People who believe that Eth 2.0 will solve the high fees need to watch this talk by Vitalik Buterin	1629015609.0	158	"But everyone that is going to move to L2 solutions hasn't yet. L2 solutions are still maturing too.

The thought is rollups and side chains will mature and be adopted more by dapps that currently take up a lot of EVM execution (gas) per block, and then the merge will happen which will speed up block times and make them consistent (~~and a bump in total gas per block too? I forget about this bit~~), and all of that really coming together at around the same time will mean a dip in gas fees.

How long will that dip last before more demand brings it back up, and how long will it be congested again before data sharding happens? Not sure. But as things like NFTs move to rollups, and the merge happens, I think (hope) we will see some pretty good gas prices for at least a little while.
This is a very important topic that most seem to misunderstand. The long term scalability solution for the Ethereum ecosystem will be rollups + data shards. L1 gas fees will remain high for the foreseeable future, but it wouldn't matter because everyone will be using rollups and paying relatively low gas fees.
Thank you so much for this, everyone on Reddit seems to think 1559 was supposed to lower gas, and the merge will improve it even more‚Ä¶"

Good info on the difficulty bomb and why it must be utilized. üî•	1625992087.0	159	">EIP-1559 aims to reduce transaction fees

Where does this claim come from?

EIP1559 aims to stabilize the fees, and make them more predictable.

Of course a more efficient fee system may lead to lower fees on average (less overpaying), but so far I have not heard any core dev say that this EIP aims to lower the fees.
tldr; The London hard fork is scheduled to take place on August 4th, 2021. It will be the third hard fork in six years, following the Istanbul and Berlin hard forks. The London fork will contain several EIPs, most notable of which are 1559 and 3554. EIP-1559 aims to reduce transaction fees through a somewhat controversial method that will reduce the supply of Ether.

Interesting! Definitely look forward to seeing how the economics turn out.

I do have the concern that simply making visibility sorted by money will favor posts where there's a single concentrated interest wanting them promoted (ie. ads) at the expense of other content.

Ideally visibility should depend on the diversity and not just the economic strength of support, though I can see how that's hard in a fully pseudonymous system (I guess as a first approximation you could 10x-count the first dollar of contributions from each POAP holder or something similar). Another interesting alternative would be to have a DAO that flags spam (or other negative-value content), and have burns for posts simply be 3-month locks in the normal case, but only become burns if the DAO decides that the post is spam.

I'm not going to dox myself, but I work in this industry so I have a lot experience in crypto and crypto regulation. Blockchain is an amazing technology and can improve efficiency of the world in many ways. The language in the infrastructure bill is ridiculous as it conflates validators as brokers, which would imply validators must provide know your customer information that the technology doesn't permit them access to. I think regulators should understand the nuances of these things before they put a bunch of red tape down on an emerging industry.

However, crypto is not always a positive force in society...Which is why regulators need to  be more active on clamping down on scams and bad actors. There are multibillion dollar ponzi schemes being operated by Americans (like HEX) that never seem to attract the attention of the regulators, and sketchy exchanges frontrunning and countertrading  their users using private orderflow data.

I think regulators should also clearly define what is a security and what isn't, because token founders and exchanges are operating in this grey area that does not benefit anyone. The Howey test, which is used by the SEC to define an investment contract was created in 1946, and the language is hard to transfer to realm cryptocurrencies. We need *new* updated language specifically crafted to define what types of digital assets are securities and which aren't.

808	The OpenEthereum issue has been resolved with v3.2.3 release. All systems go!	1618509226.0	151	"ERC20 send/receive still disabled on Coinbase
Looking at the PR, here is roughly what I think the bug was (would be nice if someone could confirm since this is my first time looking at the code):

### Background:

EIP-2929 makes changes to gas costs of the SLOAD opcode, which smart-contracts use when loading data from the blockchain.  The first time a contract tries to load data about another address, the gas cost is now 2600, but if the same address is read a second time in the same transaction, the cost drops to 100.  This is because the address is considered ""warm"" (kind of like how it's faster to read from RAM than from a hard-drive).

Second, a number of ""precompile"" smart-contracts are basically hard-wired into the blockchain, they are considered part of the protocol. They're basic functions for things like verifying cryptographic signatures and other things that many smart-contracts may need to do often.  EIP-2929 indicates that the addresses of these precompile contracts should already be considered warm (""pre-warmed""), so the gas cost is always 100 to use them.

### The Bug:

Apparently not all precompiles are considered ""active"" (not exactly sure that counts as active, maybe some are deprecated?), and only _active_ precompiles should have been pre-warmed.  OpenEthereum failed to do this check and pre-warmed every precompile, regardless of whether it was active or not.  

This meant that OpenEthereum would end up calculating the gas costs of certain transactions differently from other clients.  Since checking total gas spent is part of verifying a block, when OpenEthereum saw a new block post-fork, it got a different answer for gas used than what the block itself claimed.  Therefore OpenEthereum thought the block was invalid and basically got stuck.

I believe the bug would only be triggered if a smart contract called an inactive precompile, which I guess isn't too often since it never happened on testnet.

809	The Limits to Blockchain Scalability - Vitalik Buterin's educational text on the scaling debate	1621799642.0	150	"/u/vbuterin ser how do you see the inevitable dominance of staking derivatives in PoS (eg Lido) would affect the likelihood of users running their own nodes (where the staked Eth can't be readily used in defi apps) vs using a staking pool like Lido, and using the stETH token in defi? 

There's also MeV - if staking pools have a direct router (not sure of this is the right word) to Flashbots, then staking with one of these pools would give stakers additional MeV revenue, not available to users running a node from home 

Would there need to be additional tweaks to incentivise users to run their own nodes? Or do you think there's a sufficient altruistic culture in the ETH community that we'd see sufficient nodes run by individual users even if it's less ROI than using a staking pool?
I have a love/hate relationship with Vitalik posts, I love how honest they are, and I hate that he includes so many sublinks I once again try to tackle the hard math ones. The polynomial explanation of how ZKSNARKS works baffles me every time, but I am eternally impressed how readily available valuable research data like this is freely given, ensuring future generations understand how we got here.

The state/storage dilemma I resonate with, and I'm glad it's such a high priority focus, even though I find it hard to rationalise that we're aiming for consumer hardware when in the future the 32ETH (or, as often touted, 16ETH for RPL) price of running a node[1] may be out of regular consumer reach. Many kudos to all the peeps working on these problems, I can't for the life of me contribute but it's fascinating watching from the sidelines.

edit: [1] This should say VALIDATOR. You don't need 32ETH to run a NODE. A mistake I've made multiple times now.
Loved reading this, because it's obvious that the Ethereum corporation understands that none of this shit matters if the mainstream layman folks can't participate in the network. It is a solid admission of the need to focus on improving the user experience of the entire concept of blockchain technology, and that is an enormous pain-point to tackle.

815	My unedited, uncensored thoughts about Ethereum, Cardano, Tezos, formal proofs and functional programming being a gimmick	1622820870.0	149	"Hi Victor. First, I want to say that I have been following and am a big fan of your ~~Formality~~ Kind language. I am earnestly rooting for you, and hope that it gets more widely used. (Aside: porque no los dos? IMO the Kind language could be used to great effect in the Cardano ecosystem)

I think you make fair points regarding Haskell. I love the language for the same reasons that you do, but it has a lot of awkward baggage that makes it harder for me to use it day-to-day than it should be (I'm a data scientist in my day job): a complete zoo of language extensions, inconvenient package manager, and weirdly named abstractions that make it hard to get my team up to speed with development on this language.

Regarding Cardano, I think it would be a disservice to the project to claim that the *only* distinguishing factor that Cardano brings to the table is merely the fact that its implementation is written in Haskell. Cardano has many other contributions to the blockchain space, including:

* A formalization of the Bitcoin protocol into a mathematical model, defining and proving its fundamental properties ([GKL 2015](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-46803-6_10)). This paper has since been cited more than a thousand times, and is considered a valuable baseline model to analyze blockchains.
* The Ouroborous Proof of Stake consensus protocol (described in the [Classic](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroborosa-provably-secure-proof-of-stake-blockchain-protocol/), [Praos](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-praosan-adaptively-securesemi-synchronous-proof-of-stake-protocol/), [Genesis](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-genesiscomposable-proof-of-stake-blockchains-with-dynamic-availability/), [Chronos](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/ouroboros-chronospermissionless-clock-synchronization-via-proof-of-stake/) and other papers). You can like or hate the approach they took, but these are valuable theoretical contributions to the blockchain space‚ÄîOuroborous is a protocol constructed from the ground-up in a principled way.
* The [Extended UTXO Model](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/the-extended-utxo-model/). The beauty of this model is that it allows fully expressive smart contracts (similar to the range of functionality in Ethereum), with only the following three simple additions to Bitcoin's original UTXO model. This allows smart contracts to be implemented as state machines that evolve their state with transactions, and propagate it by requiring the inclusion of state data in transaction utxos.
   1. Each utxo can have arbitrary metadata (structured or unstructured) attached to it.
   2. Each submitted transactions has a validity interval during which it can be validated, and it cannot be validated outside of that interval.
   3. Validator scripts that guard the consumption of utxos have access to a wider context‚Äîthe transaction that intends to consume the utxo, all other utxo inputs to the transaction, all utxo outputs from the transaction, and all the signatures included in the transaction. However, this context is much narrower than Ethereum's validation context. This allows transactions involving smart contracts to be simulated locally prior to submission, and to have their resource consumption and costs to be determined prior to submission. The success or failure of a smart contract transaction is determined solely based on the availability of its input utxos to be consumed and the validity of that consumption according to the validators that guard the inputs.

I think that these innovations are worthy of consideration on their own merits, and they are entirely independent of the choice of Haskell as the implementation language. I do not see any reason why Cardano and Ethereum cannot continue to co-exist as two projects that explore separate points in the design space for blockchains.

Regarding your questions about Cardano's smart contract language, here is how I would characterize Plutus and Marlowe:

* [Plutus](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/functional-blockchain-contracts/) ([github](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus)) is a set of libraries written in the Haskell language that allow you to write off-chain and on-chain code in a single Haskell source file.
   * The on-chain source code defines the validation scripts that should be attached to utxos and will guard their consumption in subsequent transactions (validators have type `Datum -> Redeemer -> ScriptContext -> Bool`). The on-chain code gets compiled down to a more minimal language called Plutus Core.
   * The off-chain source code is responsible for querying the blockchain and constructing valid transactions for submission into the blockchain to evolve smart contract state. Off-chain code is evaluated by the user's wallet or dApp frontend, while on-chain code is evaluated by a validator node (e.g. a stakepool node) for each input utxo to be consumed by a submitted transaction.

* [Marlowe](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/marloweimplementing-and-analysing-financial-contracts-on-blockchain/) ([github](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/tree/master/marlowe)) is a narrow DSL for financial contracts, built on top of Plutus. It provides more guard-rails for people that want to build financial contracts with it, and Marlowe financial contracts can be exhaustively analysed to provide strong guarantees to contract participants. Some properties of the DSL (e.g. conservation of money) have been formally proved in Isabelle. Also, an increasing selection of the financial contracts from the [ACTUS standard](https://www.actusfrf.org/) have been implemented in Marlowe.

A Geth node that has been running for a year will indeed take up that kind of space. But if you wipe the chaindata folder and resync, it will come in about 300GB. Old state trie data doesn't get deleted from an existing node, but it also doesn't hang around during a fresh sync. Periodically resyncing can reduce total disk space.

Second, if you've been offline for a year, have you updated your node software? There's a good chance it will get stuck behind a hard fork, and barring that it will at least be missing some critical security updates.
Not a wallet.  I assume you are talking about the size of the blockchain?  I don't think it's quite that big yet, but if you are running Geth, all the stuff together might take up that much.

827	Value of holding Ether?	1609006315.0	144	"1. Layer 2 scaling solutions will reduce the amount of ETH consumed to per transaction (lower costs allow greater demand)
2. Utility creates a different type of demand. Because bitcoin is demanded solely because it's a limited supply asset, people hold bitcoin almost solely in the expectation it will be worth more in the future. 

However, people hold ETH because its very likely that ETH will drive future digital markets. ETH is also limited supply so it's like comparing gold and silver. Both have their uses, however one tends to be rarer, harder to get, and more prized because of those facts.

When Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 becomes reality, Ethereum will have a deflationary supply; thereby making ETH increasingly scarcer as time goes on. So not only will ETH begin to become scarcer (more valuable) it will also have so many use-cases that there's a very real possibility it will be demanded more than bitcoin (10 -20 years) in the future.

Bitcoin is like digital Gold. Rare, but not so many use cases. Ethereum is like digital oil. Not quite as rare (yet) but with many use cases creating consistent demand.

You have to decide for yourself which is more useful (and therefore demanded) in the long term.
1: Price of eth doesnt increase the cost of transactions.


2: increased demand for eth means price of eth goes up.
As the network scales and L2 solutions are adopted, we expect transaction price to go down (it's already very low for L2). This will be made up by the large increase in volume (currently \~35 TPS on L1 and \~3K TPS on L2). Unlike bitcoin, soon we won't need to pay miners for security, and paying stakers is much cheaper (no need for expensive hardware and electricity). For example if 10% of ETH is stakes (and that's a lot), and 0.5% of total supply is paid annually, then stakers get 5% APY (which is nice), but the total cost (average) of sending ETH multiple times over in a year is 0.5%, compared to \~2% for a single transaction today by visa."

As a very general note, I have the feeling that blockchain in general and its value proposition in particular are already very hard to grasp for the general public.

1. is there a set limit to the 'tip' amount?
2. if the BASEFEE is increased and burned, miners getting normal value 2 ETH + tips... what incentive does the user then have to tip the miner? does this move them to the front of line or is it just a gesture?
3. Really I just see this as ""miners you can't make money"" because the Basefee of ETH will still increase meaning the price/usage of ETH process transaction still goes up to a certain amount. But what once going to miners is now just getting burned.
4. Honestly how many times in ETH lifetime has miners really made money? 2017 when it took off with ICOs, then crashed. Ever since then there 'wasn't an issue' with ETH network or miners fees... now that ETH getting heavy usage... and miners are making profits for once 'Oh we have to fix this!'

There is a little more time for us to see a complete one. Let's say, it will arrive very soon.
I think we should wait an see the effects of this EIP first. If we'll have the same number of transactions with a lower gas cost then it's a clear win.

835	Time To Fight Like We Did When Mnuchin Tried to Rush Through Bad Crypto Policy	1627675041.0	142	"did my part. Contacted both senators and congresswoman. 

if any of u guys want to copy/paste what i wrote, i modeled it off the guy‚Äôs twitter thread:  


Hello Congresswoman X,  
It has come to my attention that there was a last minute cryptocurrency provision added into the US Infrastructure Bill.   
The new provision has been added that expands the Tax Code's definition of ""broker"" to capture nearly everyone in crypto, including non-custodial actors like miners, forcing them all to KYC users.  
The bill expands the definition of a ""broker"" to include ""any person who (for consideration) is responsible for and regularly provides any service effectuating transfers of digital assets.""  
I have an issue with this definition because it is so broad, it can apply to every single economic actor in the cryptocurrency industry.   
The scope here is massive.  
This is a deeply misguided provision that, if adopted, will do far more harm than good to US interests.  
I'll give you my top four reasons why:  
First, it defies logic to adopt a regulation for which compliance is literally impossible, unless the goal is to kill the industry.  
Second, it'll be a huge foreign policy failure.  
After China made the geopolitical blunder of forcing miners out of their country, many of us hoped the US would take market share in this crucial sector. This is a growing sector that can provide jobs and more tax dollars to the government in the future.   
Third, it won't work. For every new dollar of tax revenue, we'll lose two (or ten) as the US crypto industry shuts down or goes offshore. I want to keep these businesses IN the USA. This is a brand new, innovative technology that we CAN be the leader in.   
Lastly, the burden it'll place on civil rights is unacceptable.  
Our 4th Amendment right to privacy limits how much surveillance government can mandate without a warrant, & in a post-SolarWinds world, the last thing we need to do is expose more sensitive information to a security breach.  
Please help to get this last-minute, ill thought out crypto provision out of the infrastructure bill.  
This is not the way to do it. It is a haphazard job and we need to take some more time to think about the implications.   
Thank you so much for your consideration.
This is very important. Requiring all crypto participants do KYC on everyone using their systems (i.e. miners/stakers would need to know who every person submitting a transaction to them is! Impossible!) could either break decentralized public goods like Ethereum entirely (less likely), or drive it underground (more likely), neither of which we want.

I called both my senators, got actual people at both of their offices, said my piece, and was told by both staffers that they would pass my thoughts along to the actual senators.

Please don't assume contacting your own politician is futile - getting a phone call from their actual constituents can be extremely convincing to a politician! Ultimately they need our votes!
I'll simply vote with my feet.

Oh, US only? I guess I won't even need to vote, then. I hope you all to find legal ways to get away from their political reach. There are some nice islands if you're ready to leave them with their inflated US dollar."

844	If EIP-1559 was active, over $50M in ETH would have been burned yesterday, as 31K ETH was spent on fees.

Hold on... it‚Äôs BASEFEE + tip
So not all 31k eth would‚Äôve been burned. Only the basefee is burned.
We have been mining for about a month now.  Our farm is 20 rigs, 119 cards and consists of 2 farms.  We have built up to 5GH over the month so the numbers are a bit misleading, but here they are...

Farm 1 - ETH Mining on Hiveon Pool - 6.5 ETH  
Farm 2 - ETHash selling to NiceHash - .03625 BTC

No low-value transactions will take place on Ethereum mainnet, the high costs will make it only affordable for large players. However, there's rich ecosystem of rollups attached to Ethereum for users to use. Some rollups are super low-cost, and are used for payments, others are specialized for trading, others are great for NFTs and gaming. Thankfully, there's a great series of bridges, and most users never know which rollup their assets are actually on, since moving from one to another only takes less than a second and costs less than a cent.

I've read about people getting worse returns after migrating, how can you tell whether/when it's worth it, assuming you don't want to change the spread at all?

868	Proposal for Uniswap: UNI should become an oracle token	1620774608.0	134	"If they need true off-chain price data then they should just use Chainlink like everybody else because it's clearly the best and most secure solution available. The lack of crypto-economic incentives is being addressed, as seen in their [whitepaper 2.0](https://chain.link/whitepaper), and by the time anything is built with UNI, it will probably be live on CLs network
I take it in this line do you mean ""algorithmic"" stablecoins? Versus collateralized stable coins. 

stablecoins need an oracle for the price of ETH/USD to be able to function, and they specifically need an oracle for USD the off-chain fiat asset, and not any specific on-chain instantiation of USD.

I am with you on all the key points as to what attributes an oracle needs, I am unclear on why an authoritative body needs to provide that information.

To me, uniswap is already providing oracle services on algorithmic stable coins BY ITS VERY EXISTENCE.  I can look at the Eth/$ (or rupee) price of any of the stable coins pools and instantly see how well they are doing relative to each other.  I can then go to coinbase (or Google) and see how that compares with the off-chain market for Eth.

I'm still struggling for why a new oracle service is imperative in the first place. To provide information for new synthetic assets, but what is the ""true"" price of that asset? If I create tokenized tsla, it'd not ""real"" tsla, because I can't vote with my share, I won't get a dividend, etc.  With an oracle giving me information such that I can compare my ""synthetic tesla share"" and a ""real tesla share"", what use case is open to me? I'm ultimately still betting on the price of a share, rather then owning an actual share. 

In short, I think the  ""true"" price is what someone is willing to pay on-chain.  If eth is 5$ lower on coinbase than it is on-chain, they are fundamentally different assets.  I'm paying 5$ less and I'm getting an IOU (and the exchange and I are saving gas fees)?
I like the idea of increasing governance on L2 like UNI. That makes sense.

I thought AMMs needed low-latency oracles though. Maybe I'm not clear about that."

873	Did I just lose all my ETH? Sent from BEP20 to Trezor....	1609201086.0	131	"> whatever that means

If at any point you end up saying ""whatever that means"" you should stop and find out what it means. Otherwise this exact scenario is most likely going to happen because you do one thing expecting another to happen, when in fact even your first move was completely incorrect.
You have your seed phrase so you‚Äôre still in custody, you would have to connect to BSC mainnet using your seed phrase, BSC and ETH use the same address for both networks if you have the seed phrase.

You could connect your Trezor to metamask via the eth app and switch the network to BSC mainnet in metamask, I do this with my ledger all the time. Then you can transfer the tokens via metamask. You have to add BSC mainnet to metamask as a custom network.

Custom RPC from the drop down at the top of metamask: 

Network Name: BSC Mainnet
New RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
ChainID: 0x38
Symbol: BNB
Block Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com/

Edit: Don‚Äôt actually type your seed phrase anywhere, you can connect metamask to your hardware wallet
This is what you need to do - There will be some figuring out on the way, but you'll be fine.

The idea is Metamask does support the Binance (BEP20) network. You just need to figure out how to (keyword) ""Add a Custom Network"" to Metamask. A guide is here: [https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html#what-is-it](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html#what-is-it)

After that you need to (keyword) ""Connect Trezor to Metamask"", a guide is here: [https://wiki.trezor.io/Apps:MetaMask](https://wiki.trezor.io/Apps:MetaMask)

From there you can deposit to Binance and withdraw the appropriate ETH to the Ethereum network. Pretty sure you need no guide for this.

Just be mindful - 1. Make sure you download the correct Metamask instance else a malicious copy will steal all your funds, 2. At no point of time should you be required to give out your seed phrase or private keys. Everything can be done without doing so, 3. Always double, triple check to ensure your funds are going to be transferred to the address you desire  


To add, your funds are safe (assuming correct address). It's just that Trezor do not natively support BEP20 assets; However as BEP20 assets are on a chain largely compatible with Ethereum, having the private keys on Ethereum = having the same on Binance Smart Chain. So as long as it is an address you own private keys to, you have access to the assets. Heck, you could leave it there if you'd like and it'll be fine, though better cross the bridge earlier than later."

i cant find anything on this topic..  
do i get it once per week/month/year?  
where will it be getting sent to?  
is it getting stacked to my deposited eth, and am i only able to withdraw the rewards + the deposit at once, once i decide to stop staking?  


how does it work - payout wise?  


thanks"

if anyone is interested, it's easy to short Wrapped Bitcoin against Eth on Aave. Deposit some eth and borrow wbtc against it, then swap the wbtc to eth and deposit that too. then you can borrow more wbtc and do the same a couple times to increase leverage to your desired risk tolerance level. to unwind the position, withdraw some eth, swap for wbtc and pay it back to the protocol. repeat until the position is closed or you arrived at your new risk tolerance level. 

if eth is worth more wbtc during the unwinding than originally, you can pocket the difference. on Polygon, this setup is doable with close to 0 network fees. dyor, this can be risky!

>6. EIP-1559 should at least modestly decrease the rate of ETH inflation

I appreciate that you're not exaggerating but IMO it's too understated. With EIP-1559 Ethereum probably is going to be **deflationary**, maybe like 1-3% per year, or even more! I cannot underline enough what a game changer this is!
The transactions fees are the biggest hurdle for general public adoption IMO. I am just realizing how ridiculous it is because I have been testing the process of sending crypto from an exchange to a metamask account to a cold wallet. The fees and transaction time are outrageous. $40 to transfer $1200 worth of crypto? 3 days to complete the transaction?

You need to sell the USDC to USD again on the Kraken side OR buy ETH with USDC, but the fees for the transfer and exchange are still less than a wire fee if you are doing it in small lots say $100- $500 at a time.

901	"Can I ""gift"" 15k in ETH to my friend's wallet so they can cash it out without either party being taxed via the rules of gifting?"	1612396696.0	123	"i wish there were more people talking about this. i have a feeling that the IRS is going to fuck a lot of people just for not understanding their unclear or non-existent tax laws.
If you are in the US, this would not legally avoid any taxes. When you gift it to them, they get your basis. So when they sell, they still owe taxes on all the gains.
There is no legal tax avoidance through gifts it just passes on to the recipient.   If you gift it to your friend you don't have to pay taxes and your friend doesn't have to pay taxes to receive it but when he sells the ETH for USD he will owe capital gains and **his basis is what your basis was.**  


So if you bought 1 ETH @ $1,000 and it is now let say $3,000 that is a $2,000 gain.  If you sold you would owe taxes on the $2,000.  If you give it to your friend then his basis is $1,000 and if he sold right away he would owe taxes on the $2,000.  If he waits and ETH goes to $5K then he would owe taxes on the $4K gain no different than if you held it instead of giving it to him.  


Now in some situations this may still make sense.  Lets say your friend is in a lower tax bracket and you genuninely wanted to gift him some money.  It would make more sense tax wise to gift him the ETH and let him sell it than you selling the ETH and gifting him the cash."

Best case would be the average user not even being aware of him/her using blockchain technology when booking/paying/investing or whatever.

This is an extremely popular opinion, Vitalik himself often talks about this problem. Projects like Argent Wallet are geared towards users who want to reap the benefits of defi without having to deal with the messy UX.

My unpopular opinion is that Ethereum's infrastructure is not ready for an influx of users. We really need to rally around some L2 scaling solutions before this space has widespread appeal (hard to pitch DeFi to people who are only playing with a few hundred bucks since transaction costs are often 20 dollars). 

I don't think we're truly ready until we have EIP 1559 (to stabilize transaction fees), ETH 1 rolled into ETH 2, and actual liquidity on Layer 2. Give us 9 to 18 months, then we'll actually be able to give new users a good experience.

Why would I borrow money when the gas tax is a fifth of the transaction amount.
Governance will likely be the new meme of this bull cycle. 99% of protocols with governance will never fully develop or give any real control to their holders. Additionally governance can become captured by whales while a protocol is young and at a low marketcap.

931	Does anyone else think wallets are still very confusing?	1619269868.0	118	"I personally hate soft wallets. I have lost about 4 Eth total due to the nature of them. Meanwhile I was able to recover the Eth I had in Coinbase by proving my identity which is currently impossible with a soft wallet. Also there is the stories of people losing money to fake soft wallets on the App Store, which is all the symptom of the same problem: the philosophy behind soft wallets is being personally responsible for your crypto and password/passphrases and a lot of people (like myself) aren‚Äôt good with that sort of responsibility.

I am not against all wallets, I really like my Trezor for example. But I made my Trezor all about the physical security of the item instead of all the passcodes and pins: my pin is on tape on the back of my Trezor. Sure if someone can get access to it they can clean it out, but I will never accidentally lock myself out of it like with soft wallets in the past.

Asking people new into crypto to buy a hardware wallet is a bit much, and I think leaving money on exchanges is a decent middle ground. The community needs to eventually understand for many people that extra layer makes crypto more useful. Instead of demonizing the exchanges we should push people who know they aren‚Äôt going to be able to keep track of a soft wallet property into exchange diversity: aka put a little in Coinbase put a little on Krakken and so on.

Same thing with staking: stakers with less than 32 Eth are pushed to a Rocketpool which I am pretty sure people in the US shouldn‚Äôt touch because of the liquidity tokens. Instead we should push people to diversify their staking and stake across exchanges and what I call ‚Äúeasy pools‚Äù (aka Stakewise).
I think first and biggest issue is the name ""wallet"", it's a terrible and misleading metaphor for what's going on.  Then when you couple that with the really loose way people talk about them, even people that actually understand what a ""wallet"" is doing it leads to a lot of confusion. 

The first thing people need to understand is that their coins/tokens only ever exist on the corresponding block chain, they are never ""in"" your ""wallet"".  So much confusion stems from that simple fact, yet all over the place people say things like ""store your coins in a cold wallet"".  

We repeat phrases like ""not your keys, not your coins"", but I don't think most people really quite understand what that means, it's just dumb luck that they usually get the hint to transfer the coins to an account/address they control directly.
I think it OK to take baby steps, starting with a centralized exchange until you understand it more, then slowly working your way into the ecosystem."

943	Trust Models -- vitalik.ca	1597970903.0	116	"He used really strange nomenclature. Normally you call the betrayers t and the total number n.

(Without signatures) you already can show with the Byzantine Generals Problem that you only need 

N >= 3t + 1

Once you add signatures, like general1 cannot say to general3 that general2 said attack (while he said to escape) because the signature would show the manipulation, you can reduce the number a bit more. If you have an asynchronous system (one is ahead one is behind and it shall be acceptable) it's much more complex (That's why you built the airplane and the nuclear intercontinental rocket synchronous).

Bitcoin definitely doesn't have 50% (like N/2 like vitalik calls it) trustless stability, that's simple to proof mathematically, maybe really close as the number of players is quite high.

I am confident you break Byzantine tolerance of bitcoin if you add enough delay. The 50% trustless state is maybe achievable with exactly 0 network delay.

I can tell you because the ARINC SaveBus design has huge importance to limit the delay to 1us. And you see how ethereum fucked up completely in mandala because they don't understand the importance of a voting regarding the current time base. Like every variable input needs to be voted on, just like you do it in the design of safety critical systems (remember the Boeing fiasco when you don't vote for one variable...)

Bitcoin has the same problem, introduce a delay of information up to one block and the security drastically goes down, nowhere near 50%. I think I have read it would be only around 33% for bitcoin but can further be reduced, ""just"" (not so simple but doable) increase communication delay. I am pretty sure you can bring it down to a single malicious actor taking down bitcoin if you can control network delay. It the classic trouble of every critical systems.

I wouldn‚Äôt do it before it is not an one way bridge. Lock 32 ETH without knowing what is going to happen it is too risky for someone who has not thousands of ETHs
A lot depends on your values. If you‚Äôre in crypto for the long term to build the first globally decentralized network where home users can participate in consensus, then you should stake in phase 0.  If you‚Äôre in to day trade on short term price fluctuations, then you probably don‚Äôt want to lock it up in Phase 0."
950	ELI10: What is happening with Medalla?	1602938798.0	113	"To be honest, this looks like a very good edge case test.

Imagine governments starting a crack down on eth2 sometime in the future. They start discovering who the validators are and locking them up one-by-one. That's why these validators cannot properly exit their nodes and are being slashed. 

There are, of course, also validators that are not discovered, but it takes some time until the network adapts to a new (smaller) set of validators.

This is the worst-case scenario that won't likely ever happen, but it's good that we are testing it to see how the network would adapt and survive.

Would love to hear what others think of this (Perhaps u/vbuterin ?) üôÇ
In the last [Eth2 implementers call](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/HyGGLCBww), it was acknowledged that Medalla is not finalizing, but it wasn't considered a bad thing:

> Even though we might see a big drop in participation, we will still be able to gather syncing data etc and Medalla can still serve a purpose.

> As of today, participation is low, but worth running for a few weeks to see the inactivity leak in action and otherwise stress-test clients.
In regards to A, there was another Prysm bug that was causing issues syncing the chain and Lighthouse updated to 0.3 which required you to resync the chain. In my opinion if possible the lighthouse client should have synced the chain while the old chain ran and once it reached the head within a few slots, it could have switched over and dumped the old chain data."

Thanks for the writeup. Loss of history going forward will likely be bothersome more than other backwards incompatible changes. Would it not be easier for everyone involved to, say, still have the capability in the node to store everything but by default to prune at 365 days?

Ultimately it will always be the node operator's decision but (at first glance) it feels it doesn't make the core devs' lives any harder while making others' lives harder who were relying on it or needing it. ETH holders too when considering that accounting for tax purposes often needs to access >1 year worth of tx data (I can see tax software people justifying higher costs while passing the blame).

958	Pros/Cons of staking via Coinbase	1620232642.0	112	"1.  Staking is the act of depositing ETH to activate validator software. As a validator you‚Äôll be responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This will keep Ethereum secure for everyone and earn you new ETH in the process. This process, known as proof-of-stake.
2. This gives you the ability to HODL, Earn some money, and help secure the network in a similar way that buying a mining rig would have done.
3. The current APR is higher than 6%(I think 7.5\~%?), but coinbase is taking a fee for handling the responsibility of actually staking the coins.
4. The downsides of staking on Coinbase would be:  
‚Ä¢ That you're getting less than you could if you staked yourself or through via other options and although it's not extremely complex to do, it is not as easy as some people say.  
‚Ä¢ Storing your ETH in an exchange, which is not necessarily recommended, but the risk is minimal, and in many cases less than storing your coins yourself. I know many people who've done this improperly and got their money stolen or lost.  
‚Ä¢ Since staking becomes the ""voting power"" the more money that is staked at coinbase gives them more of said power, and decentralizing that power is always better, but the risk is minimal  
‚Ä¢ If you stake now, your coins are locked until ETH2 is merged, which is looking like it's going to be 6-12 months, but could be longer and in a worse-case could be never, which would mean you lose your stake. This is highly unlikely, but still a non-zero risk.  


  
Personally, I've been going back and forth with where to stake myself, and have decided at least to partially stake with coinbase due to the ease. I know I'm losing a bit of interest, but staking on my own is more complicated than people suggest and even if its fairly low-maintenance, its an added worry in my mind to verify that the server is running, and if I am traveling and lose internet or power or something else, then I have to panic and figure out a solution remotely...  


I also considered staking with something like rocketpool, but it's still beta and from my understanding, there is still a reasonable risk when staking there as well.
[deleted]
I was going back and fourth (and losing money), and finally just decided to stake it on coinbase for the up to 6%.  A few reasons why, first and FOREMOST, I'm apparently horrible at resisting the temptation to jump from ship to ship looking for a new pump.  I started with $4,500 a month or so ago, new to crypto, and as of yesterday, got myself down to $2700.  I was up to $5300 at one point, down to $2500, then back up to $4100, and so on.... I keep planting trees and then deciding I like them somewhere else in my yard...  second and maybe even more important, I'm tired of looking at charts all day/night, checking balances, when I should be spending time with my family (more attentively).  This shit shit will grow, but it needs time, with all valuable things in life.  This is just my short term experience, food for thought.  Having it on CB (staked) prevents me from moving my trees, allows me to earn on-top of whatever ETH grows too, and I get more time back with my family.  Already checking my balances less.  And I kinda feel relieved.
Edit: 4 days since I posted this and I still support this stance.  ETH has been booming, and so has my portfolio.  Went all in on ETH 4 days ago.  Keeping forever."

This article takes a closer look at the prospects of EIP 1559 proposal and how it intends to change the existing gas fee mechanism. Also, why some Ethereum miners are opposing.	1623415570.0	111	"Lmao, of course miners oppose EIP-1559. Stop reading articles most journalists don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre writing about. Once we are in a POS and burn system it will be Deflationary.
When 1559 was proposed, fees were like 3% of supply annualized... today I think they are 0.5% of supply... 1559 will be much less of a shock to supply than people think BUT the game mechanics of not incentivizing high fees seems to be paying off.

While *technically* 1559 does nothing to lower fees (overall), but it does 100% remove the incentive for miners to artificially inflate fees... which might keep them near $5 vs $50.

Long term, we will see, but it would be kind of funny if 90% of fee cost was miners price gouging.

That was excellently explained! Thank you for the post, much appreciated. I am fairly new (2 months) to Ether and decided to buy into this crypto over Btc, mostly because I like what Ethereum is as a digital world. However, as I‚Äôm learning more about it I started to realize how expensive it is to use - definitely not a good User Experience. I am not a miner, therefore I would like to see gas prices lowered but I realize the implications it has on the revenue of the miners.

969	Old school business owner with a unique use case idea for blockchain. Please advise.	1615609552.0	112	"Speaking as a backend developer

Why does this idea need blockchain? What is the value add. 

If there is a usecase for blockchain next step you need to draft requirements. What should this application do and how will people interact with it? How many people need to interact with it etc. Outline usecases.

After that you can get a experienced dev to outline a system that can solve your issue and see if it's viable. Then you need hire a dev team with a developer for the frontend ui, backend devoloper for the apis, and probably a solidity dev for blockchain and smart contracts. This could all be one experienced developer or a large team depending on how fast you want this built and how much money you have to spend. You will need devs to maintain the system and continually build new features on it and also ideally the same one's who built it.
Overall this is not cheap because good devs are expensive and it's hard to lure good devs to a startup from high paying silicon valley companies.

My philosophy has always been manage your portfolio in a manner that you are happy if something falls and happy if it rises. Eth falls and I add some buys to my mining. Price rises and I sell a little more and bank expenses for six months. Ebb and flow with the price and you will always be happy. 


For the new guys reading this. ZERO LONG TERM CREDIT CARD DEBT. Use your buying power in short controlled bursts and pay that shit off fast.

Edit :spelling
Best advice if you're starting out is to decide if you're investing or trading.

Investors buy and hold for the long term. You don't care what the price is today or tomorrow, you care what the price is in 5 years, 10 years, etc... If you're an investor don't try to time the market, just dollar cost average in at whatever pace makes sense to you and hold. Don't invest money you need tomorrow and then you don't have to panic sell. Keep a little free cash around so that you can buy dips (this applies to any investing that you're doing).  


Traders do care about the price today and tomorrow. This is more difficult and requires time, energy, research, and a decent amount of capital to do well; even then it's hard. **Trading is not what most people should do.**  


Use a well known and reputable exchange to buy your crypto. Coinbase/Coinbase Pro would be my recommendation, but there are others.

However, a strong argument has been made that it is harassment, and thus should be removed, due to the personal/targeted nature of the OP's statements.

Moderators prefer to stay away from gray areas like this when it comes to policing content. Specifically, we are not comfortable censoring those who are sharing their experiences, especially when those experiences are both negative and relevant to the Ethereum ecosystem.

For most of the history of this subreddit, it hasn't been an issue.  We ask that everyone (continues) to make a good faith effort to avoid harassing posts. We are not asking people to not post their experiences.

998	When will be Ethereum 2.0 Usable?	1606742710.0	105	"According to the ""newer newer newer plan"", merging, shards, statelessness,etc. are going to be developed and implemented in parallel and the beacon chain will have functionality on top of it. So in theory it'd be a lot faster to ship, for instance, merging for ETH 1 and ETH 2 on top of the beacon chain and use of L2 channels on top of it as well but there are other heavy topics like interoperability and composability on L2s and shards which have not been solved yet and won't be solved for many years still. 

My guesstimate for when you'll be able to unlock your ETH 2 and transact with it will be approximately a year and a half which means the ETH 1 - ETH 2 merge is complete. I'm sure there are other more optimistic people with faster development time but I don't see it happening in 2021.

Smart contracts should not run on top of ETH 2 now because Ethereum is ""rollup-centric"", they will be run from rollups so it all depends on how fast dapp developers make their apps on top of L2. Some well funded teams will likely implement the first apps shortly after the merge and even before on top of ETH 1 while others will take much longer than that. My guesstimate for that will be somewhere the same 1 and a half years for rollup ETH 2 contracts. L2 on ETH 1 will be faster and some rollupnsmart contracts  will be here next year.

Phase 1 and 2 were somewhat scrapped and repurposed so sharding is no longer the main focus of scaling, L2s are. In practice phase 0 will be the first and last one to have a name and phase 1 will no longer be execution shards but ""data availability shards"" so the most likely scenario is that you will see certain launches in the next years that don't have a numerical nomenclature or phase 1 won't correspond to what was before meaning launching 64 shards which is not going to happen any time soon so phase 1 will be something else like ""data availability shards"" or ""ETH 1 ETH 2 merge"".

Here is a good thread concisely explaining milestones/timelines and associated capabilities.
