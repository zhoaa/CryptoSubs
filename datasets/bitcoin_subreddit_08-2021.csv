5	This is how easy and simple it is to send a Bitcoin payment in El Salvador. It really feels like magic internet money.	1624358240.0	21525	"There are loads of redditors commenting who are **completely uninformed** about what they're watching. I want to try and clear up some of the numerous misconceptions. Please note that Lightning Network is not perfect and there are legitimate criticisms, but few people in this thread actually understand well enough to levie those criticisms.

* *I can already do this with PayPal/Venmo/WeChat/Alipay*

Those are all 100% centralized, permissioned systems that utilize inflationary fiat currency and can ban you and seize your funds at any time. These services may appear instant to end users, but still have to navigate legacy financial networks that require days/weeks/months to actually settle payments.

* *I can already do this with my debit card / bank transfer in China/Europe/India/USA*

70% of the population in El Salvador do not have bank accounts or access to any financial services. You are bragging about using a 100% centralized, permissioned system subject to heavy inflation and which can ban you and seize your funds at any time, but that's not what El Salvador and other Latin American countries need. The number of US Dollars in existence has increased by 1000% in the past 10 years. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL

* *Haha and it only cost $20 in transaction fees!*

No, this is a Bitcoin transaction sent via Lightning Network. The transaction fee would have been about 1-2 satoshis, or around 3/100ths of one cent. Also, even without LN, Bitcoin's transaction fees are currently extremely low.

* *Okay well have fun waiting 2 days for a confirmation lmao!*

No, this is a Bitcoin transaction sent via Lightning Network. The transaction is secure as soon as it arrives in a few seconds. There is no need to wait for a confirmation.

* *Yea but Lightning Network is centralized!*

No, it's definitely not! There are [currently](https://1ml.com/) over 20,000 LN nodes and 50,000 payment channels available. Anyone can run their own LN node because it is a decentralized and permissionless protocol. It is also possible to use LN in a custodial fashion for small amounts.

* *But only on-chain bitcoin transactions count as bitcoin transactions.*

A bitcoin transaction is a bitcoin transaction. Bitcoin sent via Lightning Network utilizes multisig and smart contracts that securely and privately transmit payments without actually broadcasting them to the blockchain until counterparties decide to settle their transaction histories to the main chain. This is why LN can operate so quickly and cheaply. 

* *Bitcoin is crashing today so she already lost all her money!*

This video was recorded a couple weeks ago. It's possible that she already exchanged it for fiat or spent it elsewhere

* *Okay okay but my shitcoin can...*

**Nobody cares about your fucking shitcoin!**

The wallet app is called ""BitcoinBeach"" and is an open-source, shared custody wallet being developed by [Galoy](https://galoy.io/) specifically for this small beach community in El Salvador. https://twitter.com/nicolasburtey/status/1407418059212664832
A merchant that accepts credit cards has to wait about 2 days to get their money and most will experience chargebacks because of stolen cards.

7	Veteran Bitcoin HODLER	1624288522.0	19929	"00:13 to 00:20 is how I’ve been feeling for a few weeks now :)
Accurate. The only way to find peace in crypto is to just stop caring and let the ride happen. Thats why the addage about not investing more than you can afford to lose is so important, its the core component of crypto zen
Well, continuous repetitive trauma does that to people."
8	Andreas Antonopoulos explaining Bitcoin in 2013 (May 18th) at The Bitcoin Conference in San Jose, to an empty room. Can you imagine giving this talk to an empty auditorium with a straight face like this? So humiliating but he believed so strongly. He did this for years and deserve our gratitude.	1613930676.0	18977	"Just to clarify: This was the Bitcoin Foundation's San Jose Bitcoin Conference in May 2013.

I begged to speak and was an unknown. They finally agreed to give me a slot at the same time that Gavin Andreesen was delivering the ""State of the Bitcoin Union"" talk in the main hall. Most people were in that talk, and after it ended a few more trickled in to my room. Also, the few that were there sat in the back near the door, not quite committing to my talk and ready to leave. By the end there were 20-30 people in the last 3 rows. 

I did not find it at all humiliating. I enjoyed giving the talk and then went to watch other talks and mingle with the rest of the people at the conference. There are probably only about 500 people total if I remember. It was a fantastic experience and I met many of my ""heroes"" of the early bitcoin age that day. 

Thank you all for your kind comments.

Bit of a stretch to claim 7.6 billion people rely on the Bitcoin network.
>Carbon emissions literally transformed into money.  

No. They're still carbon emissions. Trading isn't a transformation. Let's not get carried away. Creating wealth is the benefit here. Reducing carbon is not.  Perhaps that wealth can enable some carbon efficiencies if used properly, but there is no inherent incentive to do that created here. And there are some negative incentives to continuing the flaring. The social pressure remains however, so there's hope (in addition to the new wealth, both good things which can lead to progress).  

The best thing about bitcoin's proliferation is that good people are getting rich, and will now have power to fight the bad people who have increasingly been benefiting from the central bank money printers. (yeah, yeah and freedom is good too)"

I think one of the main reasons Bitcoin's energy consumption attracts so much attention is the simple fact that it's so easily quantifiable. You can look up the hash rate and track its day-to-day fluctuations.

Imagine if we had a precise number for how much energy ever industry in the world consumed the same way we do for Bitcoin. It's arguably the most transparent industry in the world when it comes to reporting its energy consumption.
One doesn't excuse the other. 

The energy efficiency of bitcoin is both a reasonable and valid concern that has been raised and needs to be addressed.

This is some weird subversive collusion reminiscent of [the blocksize war \(everyone should read it\)](https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM). more to come.


Dear /r/Bitcoin 

Allow me to use my exorbitant privilege of green stickied comments to make the following rant. This is my personnel opinion only.

To Elon Musk. Fuck You.

~~To Michael Saylor, Fuck You Too.~~

To the Miners Who collude to censor Bitcoin transactions, Have a big, FUCK YOU.

To the idiot miners who go along with the ESG agenda, I encourage you to reconsider.

With some of that rage out of the way, lets get down to the concerns & implications of recent fuckery in the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

Setting the scene:

So we got Saylor, he comes in like a bull in a china shop and we freakin love him for it. Gets all that clout and a mass following by plebs who don't know any better about cults of personality in the Bitcoin space (they all get sacrificed in the end). 

Most Ego's in this space get greedy and lose the signal to pump different bullshit. Which is usually fine when they move on to their different projects and leave Bitcoin alone.

But this time, it feels like they are gunning for something at a Bitcoin protocol level, and I'm pissed about it so I'll try my best here to call them out on what I feel is going on.

Then we got elon, that poor tragic soul. He doesn't last long and has started spreading general misinformation these past few weeks on such a subversive level that you wonder if he's trolling or compromised.

Next, marathon patent group and DMG. These fuckers get the bright idea to only include ""OFAC approved"" transactions inside the Bitcoin Blocks they mine. great, you're allowed to do that! Even if it means you lose mining revenue for doing so, and even if it means you still include OFAC violating transactions in your blocks. Hey, at least it's a good headline and gets the regulators hard. fucking idiots.

For any mining pools or operators who are considering this slippery slope, know that it's a bad idea for you and your operation long term. You will not have community support for virtue signaling or appealing to unenforceable regulatory burden, or by lobbying to impose your bullshit standard on other miners. 

Once we start with ""OFAC approved"" blocks, it never ends. You give an inch, you give a mile. This is just the start to a slippery slope of censored Bitcoin transactions.



**So with those three elements (Saylor, Elon, Marathon) and a few other Bitcoin miners all in one room behind closed doors, they decide to form** 

[**A cartel.**](https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1396915803082080256) 



...maybe this was inevitable. But to you few who see what I see and feel what I feel, rage against the dark for you only burn once in this life. 

To [Hut8 Mining](https://twitter.com/Hut8Mining), [Argo Blockchain](https://twitter.com/ArgoBlockchain), [Riot Blockchain](https://twitter.com/RiotBlockchain), [Marathon Digital Holdings](https://twitter.com/MarathonDH), [Hive Blockchain](https://twitter.com/HiveBlockchain), [Galaxy Digital](https://twitter.com/GalaxyDigitalHQ), [Core Scientific](https://twitter.com/Core_Scientific), [BLOCKCAP](https://twitter.com/blockcap), I ask, are you a part of a intelligence agency run mining cartel?

It's a rhetorical question as you can't know the answer to this question. You should be operating under the assumption that such things are possible and proceed accordingly. cautiously. ie, not at all.

For you independent miners who use any of these pools and can switch, do so now, ideally to https://braiins.com/stratum-v2

To you fucks who are fucking around, 

[We see you](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106939193085952).

Serious question. If US tax laws are to be followed, how on Earth are people supposed to keep track of their spending in BTC? Technically, every time you make a purchase using cryptocurrency, you are supposed to treat it as a sell based on the current market price of BTC and document it on your taxes for the following year with the appropriate cost basis from when you obtained it.

How many people actually know to do this, and how many people are actually going to do this? For that matter, how many people are doing it now? I am bullish AF about Bitcoin, but tax laws cannot be followed realistically."

As a long time smoker I agree quitting isnt easy.

Not a great comparison. Most trading of Bitcoin happens on exchanges, and they absolutely can and do censor your transactions.

For example, Coinbase is well known to shut down your account if you violate the ToS by buying Bitcoin and then transferring it to a gambling site wallet.

Once decentralized exchanges take off, you might have a point, but right now almost all BTC volume is on the centralized exchanges.

But even with that being said, it's possible to buy and sell shares of stock outside of stock exchanges too. There are OTC markets, just like there are for Bitcoin.

I remember reading an article, long ago, titled “The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin.” It detailed how the crypto had trudged along at a few dollars per coin, finally rising all the way up to $25 before crashing down to $9. People who bought at $25 lost money, poor souls.

Nowadays, the rise and fall comes in waves of thousands of dollars. Thousands. SMH. Five years from now, the waves might be in the tens of thousands.

There really was a time that you could make a decent living if you were willing to work. There was a time when economy actually worked and made sense ...


Now it doesn't. You are expected to work unreasonable hours for a very small wage, which barely covers simple necessities.


In the 80s an uneducated carpenter would wake up at 8, eat breakfast with family, grab his lunch box, and walked to work while smoking a cigarette. He worked until 3 in the afternoon, got home, spent time with his family.


He could afford a house, a car, and raising 4 kids just on that salary. 


Now you are expected to have multiple degrees and alot of experience in the field, long work hours, covering multiple duties, your wife has to work too and you would still spend most of your life in debt. If you're lucky, you'll have your debts paid off in your 60s.

This event is going to kick start crypto in a way we’ve never seen possible. People are going to buy in hard. Not because they are speculating and want to get rich quick, but because they are scared of all the fuckery going on in the markets and want to protect their wealth.

This seems like a cool ass sub with level headed people. Think I’ll buy in and stay. Now convince me why it’s not a good idea to rip 500k into dogecoin."

179	If you’re like me and trying to consume as much Bitcoin knowledge as possible, I highly recommend MIT OpenCourseWare on YouTube. Taught by Gary Gensler, the nominee to head up the SEC. I can’t believe this is free! 🚀	1615047121.0	4785	"Great content. Here is a link with the other lectures https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/session-1-introduction/
The readings are absolutely key. I highly recommend this resource if you’re able to read the suggested materials before each lecture. You will learn a lot from the readings and the lectures will be more enjoyable if you approach it this way. I do not recommend this resource if you’re going to simply binge watch the lectures. The lectures are interesting discussions that probably shouldn’t be relied upon as an efficient learning resource on their own.

EDIT: The readings can be found on the open courseware website - https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/readings/
Another upvote, started watching this series today, and on the third class. The class is from 2018 but lays down the basics step by step even for those of us who are interested lay persons without an in depth finance or computer science background. (I understand about 40% of it but I'm paying maybe 35% attention so that's 14% knowledge penetration and I'm learning a lot.) 

Gary Gensler is clearly clearly an expert and I'm glad he's back in the administration. Anyone in the SF bitcoin meetup that can invite him to come and speak, I'd like to hear an update on his ideas about bitcoin, and rules around SPACs, ICOs, and other somewhat dodgy investment vehicles. (Not to put bitcoin in that category.)

Wait, so when mortgages are at historic lows, you paid for a house outright with the #1 rising asset on the planet?

Lmao why are you people clapping 🤡 

Edit- do none of you understand how a mortgage works?  If they can afford a house (and the taxes) outright with btc, then they could cash out the down payment in btc, get a mortgage, and invest the rest above the interest rate of the mortgage, and literally be making money off their money.  Its ALMOST NEVER a smart idea to buy property outright, especially when they're giving away mortgages at near 0%.
May I ask what the actual process is for buying a house with bitcoin? Like, do you sign over all the paperwork first, and then send the BTC to his wallet? I wouldn't feel comfortable sending BTC until I had all paperwork signed upfront and was in possession of the home."

That's some next level stupidity right there. The security of the pipeline corporation must be even worse then. MS-DOS level?
That price drop has nothing to do with the btc hack.  Btc is being heavily shorted right now and they are using that story as an excuse.  

I was watching the doj press briefing and btc price did not move at all.  The price drop happened about 2 hours afterwords.  

You can tell it's being shorted by how steep the drops are.  They are purposely done that way to create panic and trigger stop loss orders.
How did the FBI trace the public bitcoin address of the wallet to the rented cloud server?  When the wallet posted a transaction to the bitcoin network using the public address, did the bitcoin node(s) report the IP address of the sender to the FBI?  Does the FBI monitor IP traffic to and from all bitcoin nodes?  I'd really like to understand how this was done.  Perhaps the hackers need to use TOR to perform transactions."

okey I’m going to state what probably others won’t. Unless you’re absolutely sure you are going to have an good income in the future (and perhaps even then), this may be a bad idea because: 

1. It might be useful to have a certain amount backup in fiat money. In case you have some damage, insurance claims, etc. your fiat pot levels it out and you can keep your coins longer. 

2. Investors usually spread the risk over different assets to reduce risk perhaps you can look out for company stock where you could invest a portion. 

Good luck though xD"

223	When bitcoin starts to moon	1608994340.0	4210	"I gotta watch interstellar again. What a great movie.
yooooo I laughed so hard at “Liquidated”
I know this is gonna sound so corny but this made me tear up a bit - likely because im a total Interstellar nerd. But it just really hit me - after the last 2 almost 3 years now, all my chucking money into BTC was worth it. I was right. Felt nuts pouring money in at 3k, and many told me so equally.

Every family event I was the 'financial joke' in a sense - 'you keep investing in that bitcoin how come you arent retired yet? When you gonna buy grandma and I a car with your big money? This time next year you should've finally made your money right?' Suddenly, radio silence. And If I mention Bitcoin everyone gets all happy and excited - since weve passed 20k grandpa can't stop showing me every lotto winner - even if its $2 on a $5 card. Some sort of rationalization.

I've won. And this is, hopefully, STILL just the start of that winning journey. It's so worth it and, at 25, has given me an amazing financial cushion store mostly in assets the government can't directly inflate.

Don't underestimate this GIF and the connection of BTC > Interstellar. In a sense, We ARE trying to save the world - most people just don't know it. Whoever controls the money, especially if it's printable fiat currency, controls the people and the entire prevailing system.

While your average citizens has not realized the financial war being waged, the US and other governments have. Hence the KYC regulation, chainalysis and proposed private wallet regulations. You know it IS a real battle when the US Gov is fighting back - yet almost as quietly as possible so as not to wake up the populace. Instead of trying to 'take down BTC' traditionally, or via a chain attack, it is being done by integrating it into current systems and over-regulating it.

The world was supposed to bend to Bitcoin, Bitcoin was not supposed to bend to the world. There is still time but many won't wake up until the reality is on their doorstep. Or rather a lack of funds available to order Doordash to put food on the doorstep. Only then, maybe, will your average person at all start considering monetary theory - when it finally affects them."

They want to regulate it for consumer protection because people can lose a lot of money. Yet the top causes of bankruptcy in America are medical bills, job insecurity, and easy access to (predatory) credit. I don't see them addressing healthcare for all, basic income, or regulating banking. 

They say it's bad for the environment, when did they ever care about the environment? I don't see them agreeing with the Green New Deal, or even supporting the non-binding Paris Agreement/COP21 on climate change.

They say it's used for illegal activity but the same thing can be said about the US dollar. I don't see crypto being used to fund trillion dollar wars in the Middle East, or $800B a year for the military industrial complex.
It\`s actually crazy how fast the timeline moves right now. I think most people overlook it a bit considering the price does not currently move uo despite all the adoption and good news."

> Tesla didn’t exactly earn its record profit from selling cars, however. The company said that it sold some of the $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin that it purchased in February, contributing $101 million to the bottom line. That is nearly a fourth of its total profit.

Hilarious.

Soon, Tesla will become a financial company that sells cars as a side-hustle (which is basically what happened to VW).

Good for them. They're like a bank, but unlike a bank, they also produce a valuable product. 

I wish my bank did something productive instead of just using my money to feed vampires and sink the economy.
Why are people complaining? Tesla bought Bitcoin, Tesla sold Bitcoin. Obviously, Bitcoin works as advertised and Tesla is leveraging its functionality to their advantage.

To treat people who sell like they have ""paper hands"" (poor self-control) is essentially gatekeeping. People purchase Bitcoin for their own reasons; people sell Bitcoin for their own reasons. PEOPLE WHO HODL DO NOT HAVE THE MORAL HIGH GROUND VS PEOPLE WHO SELL.

And I'm speaking as a hodler.

I see too many reactions to people liquidating their Bitcoin as if they don't understand the value of their Bitcoin. That's NOT the issue. Currency is to be leveraged, not hoarded.
Tesla selling is bullish, at least considering its impact on people and companies not currently in the cryptospace. This does a lot to legitimize crypto to these groups and will generate more interest in it overall."

Hi, I am a Bitcoin OG, in Bitcoin since 2010. I want to give you a huge Kudos to you guys, you are killin it. You managed to do in few days what took Bitcoin years. Mainly to expose how our fiat system is completely broken and only serves the ones who controls the Wall Street with their printing press going brrrr.

I can see what your strategy with $GME is, however it has one major flaw. You are playing on their playground with their tokens. Therefore, as we have already seen, they can change the rules as they wish or simply lock you out of the playground entirely.

I am proposing you a coalition, alliance with us, Bitcoiners. We have a solution to your problem ready to be deployed. Once deployed on a large scale, there is now way back.

It wont be an easy path or quick way how to get rich. However if critical mass of people transfer their wealth into Bitcoin, the earth will start moving.

The final goal of Bitcoin is to bring back the sanity to the world of finance by serving as a global reserve asset and stop the fiat printing madness where few rich controls the printing presses and rob 99% of population thought the inflation. Bitcoin fixes this. There is and always be only 21.000.000 of Bitcoins. Full stop. If every member for WSB bought just 0.1BTC the world would be never the same. We need to take back ownership of our monetary system first and foremost. As long as they can print money, you can never win. In the end, they can easily inflate away all your gains on any stock, if they wish. They can ban your bank account or take money out of it. They simply own you. You cant win in casino if the casino itself owns the tokens you play with. Bitcoin fixesthis. You can make it happen tommorow if enough of you decide to to so.

The stock account broke even :| after the up and now the down.
My BTC is up 100% even with this correction. 
The cash earned a wooping $5 in interest. What a joke. 
Moral of the story : I’m a horrible story teller. Just buy Bitcoin.
I don’t wanna be that guy but this is wrong, i have a few bitcoins myself in hopes that someday I’ll ise it as a currency and maybe I’ll be a millionaire aswell, but putting all your eggs in one basket is very wrong for obvious reasons, and I’m not talking about buying some other crypto, I mean you should have some cash, stocks, bonds, some money in the bank whatever suits you. With all due respect for people who encourage you to do so, as a community you know better than that! What if someday you needed to sell it for emergency and prices was down? Thats one scenario i can think of.. anyway its just an advice, you can completely ignore it you wish."

264	Former CIA director publishes paper verifying that bitcoin is used for illegal activity less than the dollar	1618336068.0	3751	"It's naive to say that Bitcoin isn't.

But the dollar is far worse.

The CIA know this well.
Obviously, BTC can be somewhat annonomyous but the ledger doesn't lie and if someone tries hard enough they could potentially track you down.

Cash, greenbacks, on the other hand has always been and will always be the currency of choice for criminals, no papertrail and can somewhat easily be 'washed' through a legitimate cash business. There are some annonomyous cryptos out there but nothing on a large enough scale to even come close to the amount of illegal transactions taking place with paper money. 

Weird that paper money has no paper trail, but digital money has the most accurate paper trail.
tldr; Former Central Intelligence Agency Acting Director Michael Morrell has published an independent paper refuting the notion that Bitcoin and crypto are rife with illicit activity. Morrell found that the percentage of illicit transactions in crypto is minimal, and falling. He also said that there will be severe geopolitical repercussions for the U.S. vis-a-vis China if it wastes energy and resources chasing a ghost.

Edit: Adding a new financial education tweet she just made that really drives home a point that a lot of us here have been making for years; that financial education desperately needs to be taught in our schools so students don't start off life with a financial literacy handy cap when it comes to things like how the cash system, loan system, and credit system work, etc. That way, they don't fall for predatory student loans, or any kind of predatory financial practice aiming to trick them into making very expensive mistakes: [https://twitter.com/AarikaRhodes/status/1412867352744501248?s=20](https://twitter.com/AarikaRhodes/status/1412867352744501248?s=20)

This is secretly the most bullish news we’ve heard in a while. Obviously the impact in the short term is pretty bad but in the long run this means more hashrate decentralisation, greener energy used by miners (most of the energy used by chinese miners was from “dirty” energy sources) and imo moving the majority of the hashrate outside of the impact of the Chinese government is a big plus."

It amazes me how many people think “we need regulation” and then are willing to accept any oppressive bullshit law that they put forth. This has NOTHING to do with taxes. This forces every custodial service to act as a panopticon and watch and report every transaction you make. Which is obviously bad enough. But this is law also talks about miners, software wallet makers, hardware wallet makers, and DEXs needing to report their users transactions. It’s literally impossible to comply with this. It would be the equivalent of buying a leather wallet from Walmart but the manufacturer of the wallet needs to keep track of all your payments with cash that you keep in the wallet. It’s unenforceable for any tech that’s not custodial. And the problem with that is that they then can arbitrarily enforce it and shut down any registered company in the US that isn’t complying with their ‘rules.’ If you excuse this cause ‘crypto needs regulation’ then go fuck yourself. The solution to you losing money from scammy pump and dumps is to stop buying fucking shitcoins. That’s it.

285	Wow. 10 years ago, Bitcoin crashed from $16 to $.01! Imagine buying Bitcoin at $.01?!!!	1623604509.0	3494	"There is a lot of misconception about this crash. First thing this crash was architectured by someone who hacked into a major account on Mt Gox. The plan was to withdraw max BTC with the 1000$ withdrawal limit on Mt. Gox. The easiest way to do that was to crash the price by selling some portion of BTC @ 0.01$. That way @ 0.01$/BTC the Hacker could withdraw 100,000 BTC. 

However, there was also a limit on the number of BTC that could be withdrawn. This the hackers overlooked and couldn't get away with the master plan. Eventually all the trades executed during this flash crash were undone. So, even if you had bought the absolute bottom you still wouldn't have got to keep your bought BTCs.

The proof-of-work consensus algorithm and bitcoin's massive hashrate is why bitcoin is the most secure cryptocurrency that currently exists. The only way for it to be competitively profitable for anyone to mine bitcoin with dirty energy is if the dirty energy is being subsidized by the government, and that's not a bitcoin problem.

We see the value of a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. Bitcoin allows people to safely store monetary value outside of the reach of anyone else. And it allows people to send online payments directly to another party without requiring trust or permission of anyone else. If you properly handle your private keys then your bitcoin can't be stolen or seized and nobody can stop you from sending it to anyone else. Bitcoin's issuance schedule and maximum supply are both clearly defined and will never change. Bitcoin is decentralized and the fully validating nodes are in control. Bitcoin miners are currently creating over $50,000,000 worth of the hardest money that's ever existed every 24 hours while ensuring that bitcoin remains the most secure cryptocurrency in existence. And the average bitcoin transaction value is already currently at $290,172. Down from $516,536 which was the average bitcoin transaction value 3 weeks ago.

For anyone reading this amazing story and feeling the blues because you're still in the rat race, I just want you to know I'm a testament to the possibility of working a full time job and still doing all of the things (with your free time) OP has mentioned.

If the pandemic has taught employers and employees anything, at least in the majority of jobs that only require a laptop and a network connection, it's that the job can get done remotely. 100% remotely, with or without the virus and its mandates. If you're not in such a field, I'd look into it, because it's absolutely worth it. I used to miss the office setting and loathe another day at the house, but the freedoms it has afforded me make me want to brag like OP.

I'm just here to say it's possible to not be retired and still do the things you love. Also I keep posting this story about the Mexican fisherman because it's amazing and reinforces the idea that money isn't everything: http://renewablewealth.com/the-parable-of-the-mexican-fisherman/"

(my bitch ass only bought 2 coins though 😭)
Want a sad story?

In 2009, when Bitcoin was less than $0.01/BTC, a friend of mine gave me $20 worth of BTC for my 19th birthday in June. 

He told me to hang onto it and it would be worth a lot of money one day. He tried explaining it to me in ways that sounded crazy, using phrases like:

- Universal currency. 
- Money of the future. 
- Completely digital source of income. 

Just stuff like that. 

I didn’t take it seriously, so 6 months later, in December... My 2 year anniversary with the girl I had been dating was coming up. I felt like doing something special, but I was jobless at that time. So I sold all 2130 shares of my Bitcoin for a profit of $1.67. 

With $21.67 in hand, I went to the store, bought the ingredients for her favorite meal, bought some flowers, and went to her place to get cooking. 

It was a really nice dinner. Totally crushed it. She was smiling through every bite. We talked, we laughed, we had a good time. She complimented the meal, and then dumped me as I was clearing the table. 

... Yeah... It came out of nowhere for me too. 

I didn’t give it much thought until December 2017, when Bitcoin came up in my new circle of friends. It was at $19,000 per BTC. They were all talking about how they had missed their chance to get in on it, and I just started thinking back to my birthday in 2009, and what that friend said, and how I had thought it sounded crazy. 

But what was really crazy is that I got dumped ON my 2 year anniversary, AFTER I had cooked that girl a plate of Fettuccine Alfredo that, adjusting for the modern BTC price, would be worth $40,470,000 dollars in December of 2017.

A few days ago, that Fettuccine Alfredo was worth $125,670,000. 

I tried looking up the friend who gifted it to me. We had lost touch after I moved out of state. All of his social media had been deactivated, but I was still friends with his sister on Facebook and Instagram.

Through some of her posts, I found out her brother (my old friend) had paid off his parents house, bought his sister a house, bought himself a house, sent his sisters to college, bought everyone in his immediate family new cars, and then stopped spending. 

The houses aren’t huge. He’s living very modestly for how much money he has. He just wanted to set up his family with all they needed and then be comfortable forever. 

I know for a fact he has an obscene amount of BTC left, or cashed it out for a ridiculous amount of money, because when he gave me my $20 worth, he told me that he had invested all $8000 of his savings into BTC. 

If $20 would have been worth $125million... His $8000 would be worth TENS OF BILLIONS (depending on when he sold).

Aaaand that could have been me as well. 

Damnit.
$1001 and some would have bragged with their gains"

I know the title is a bit less inviting with all the uninformed articles and FUD on the topic recently, but this one is a really good read by one of the Coinmetrics guys (they provide valuable on-chain network and hash rate data), diving into the intricacies of bitcoin mining and mining data and the current narratives around it.

Well, Brad Sherman was voted by his peers as the #1 meanest male in all of the D.C. House by his peers.  He also is so unapproachable that a woman who was being viciously sexually harassed in his office (which is known for extremely high turnover—I wonder why?!) was afraid to report it to him out of fear he would snap at her and just get mad.

VOTE SHERMAN OUT!!  This should be bi-partisan and have nothing to do with political party.

This is good for adoption, but it's clear that the hoarding by major institutions is kicking into high-gear.  Mark my words, the strategy for every financial services company offering bitcoin will be to keep as much bitcoin within their ecosystem as possible and shed transaction value in fiat.

Case in point, Paypal is settling with merchants in cash and not bitcoin when bitcoin is used for payment.  This means you can deposit and withdraw your own bitcoin, but once you transact, it's converted into cash equivalent value and the bitcoin falls into the PayPal vaults never to be released again.

Don't get me wrong, this is the smart move for any business that wants to get involved in bitcoin.  Hoard bitcoin and dump fiat.  This is going to increase scarcity significantly as bitcoin gets siphoned from bitcoin users.  The dynamics this is going to cause are going to be absolutely fascinating to watch unfold.

**EDIT:**  Upon revision, it's not even clear to me that you can actually deposit and withdraw your own bitcoin given the proposed terms.

I honestly don't understand why they would do this unless they were trying to advertise for bitcoin. I mean if they ban it for payments but haven't outlawed it fully nor have they banned cash then it tells me two things:

1) they can't fully ban bitcoin due to unseen factors

2) the people can still effectively use bitcoin for purchases just one step removed by selling it for their cash and using their currency.

Really what's the point here? Maybe a short position by Turkish officials in futures or options in bitcoin? 🤷‍♂️
My wife lived in turkey for few years. Her family used to exchange usd to Turkish lira at around $100 for 175 lira. Or less. 

My dad was on a trip in Turkey before covid and he exchanged $100 for almost 600 liras!!!! It’s insane how fcked it got. As far as I know from friends, lots of landlords are charging refugees in USD instead of Lira.

Consider: Bitcoin's energy usage is not a flaw, it's like that **by design**. [It's the only way Satoshi could make bitcoin censor resistant.](https://bitcoinpasada.medium.com/back-to-basics-how-satoshi-designed-bitcoin-for-censor-resistance-fb00b795b35b) You have to invest a valuable, scarce resource in a trustless way to contribute to the blockchain, [and he saw no other way](https://twitter.com/documentingbtc/status/1387891062421737472) (and neither do I). 

Also, the more energy the bitcoin network uses, the more expensive it is to attack. Consider how much is spent, not only in energy, but production, and carbon emissions to protect value from attacks by adversarial forces. Vaults, military, police, weapons, buildings, laws, lawyers, accountants, auditors, etc. Bitcoin only uses energy (much less of it), which can be procured in a green, more efficient way.

I'm gonna repeat this, to debunk what is becoming common parlance even in this very forum. [Bitcoin's energy usage is not a problem, it's a feature.](https://www.coindesk.com/frustrating-maddening-all-consuming-bitcoin-energy-debate) Civilization hasn't advanced through its history by using less energy, but using more. The problem is never energy usage, it's energy production.

EDIT: People keep replying with too many ""gotcha"" arguments that are already taken care of in the articles I linked. Before wasting your time with basic stuff, I'd recommend you read them. I won't spend any time on them.
I don’t understand the point of all of these obscure consumption comparisons. So what if Despacito consumed that much electricity, and also nobody even knows off the top of their head how much those countries consume annually. That’s just a bait headline. It’s as weightless as the argument republicans use to reduce COVID severity by saying “ Oh yeah, well, XXX people died from the flu this year, so COVID isn’t that bad.” It’s like yes, that may be true, but it’s still bad. 

The point is that Bitcoin consumes a lot of energy, and compared to other cryptos that operate at a fraction of the consumption, it’s something to consider. 

I feel like I need to note that I’m a Bitcoin holder and supporter, and I hate how Musk used the energy consumption to drop the price. I just feel that we shouldn’t pretend it’s not a problem, let’s just fix it. Promote renewable mining, and highlight the people/countries who are making extended efforts to do so, or have already done so.
funny how the ""bitcoin uses so much electricity"" is void of any comparison to any other activity or company that uses electricity"

Exactly.  I'm honestly super excited for the future.  In the past year we went from a low of ~$3k to ~$40k.  That final run-up in price came on quick.

What do you expect to happen?  Literally everyone with access to bitcoin suddenly saw its value be significantly higher than ever before.  Of course it will be sell worthy to many many folks.

And that happened, right?  People have had a solid month or more now to be aware of what is going on, and to sell so as to realize their profits. We have had a major mining pool last month selling lots held coins to cash out.

Brian Noonan started this petition to United States Department of the Treasury.

Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen has serious conflicts of interest and needs to step down from her office or recuse herself from the entire situation immediately.

> Background information:
> 
> 1. Janet Yellen received roughly $810,000 in speaking fees from the hedge fund Citadel LLC who is currently embroiled in the Gamestop trade war.
> 
> 2. Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital with over 2.75 billion dollars. This came after Melvin Capital took an extremely risky gamble on Gamestop crashing and shorted over 140% of the float, which was spotted by sharp eyed retail investors on the popular subreddit r/wallstreetbets. With sheer numbers, they realized they could squeeze the hedge fund out of their highly risky positions and make a profit. 
> 
> 3. Citadel owns a large portion of the popular brokerage Robinhood.
> 
> 4. In the middle of the short squeeze against Melvin Capital and other high brow short sellers, Robinhood shut down the option to buy more stock in Gamestop and several other heavily shorted companies.
> 
> 5. This artificially lowered demand and therefore manipulated the market to a lower price so that the hedge funds/short sellers like Melvin Capital could cover some of their growing losses.
> 
> 6. Janet Yellen has received over 7,200,000 from speaking at other Wall Street Firms.
> 
> Given her ties to and payments from these firms and from specifically Citadel, Janet Yellen has a massive conflict of interest and cannot properly advise the President or the people on these matters in her current position.
> At the very least she needs to recuse herself from the situation."

Banco Azteca is a shady, untrustworthy institution with a LONG history of defrauding account holders. Some of their most notorious include locking down account movements because you need to show up in person during the pandemic, and then charging holders a ""no account activity"" fee. They also emptied the life savings account of an old man, and their explanation boiled down to ""welp, tough luck mate"".

Limitations of JPMorgan’s analysis:
1) they only consider matching private investment, ignoring public sector holdings
2) they do not consider that in a digital economy, it is easier to acquire and hold Bitcoin than it is to buy physical gold. Therefore bitcoin has a market value potential that can exceed golds many times over

Call your Senators right now at 517-200-9518. We'll connect you to their offices and guide you through the process.

When a staff member answers, tell them:

“Hi, I’m calling to ask that you support Senator Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis's amendment to the cryptocurrency provision of the infrastructure bill (H.R. 3684) . This amendment will ensure that the provision does not dramatically expand financial surveillance, harm innovation, or undermine human rights. Policies that impact basic freedom and the future of the Internet should be debated carefully and should never be attached to must-pass bills. Thank you.”
It's still a good thing that some Senators are being smarter than others by having made the effort to understand that Bitcoin is essential for the future.

Not having a mortgage hanging over my head means I can not have to worry about economic downturns, shitty jobs, shitty bosses, or working as hard as I currently do and being able to just walk away from my job if i choose.
Your daughter isn't even two, let's pray in the next 16 years the US will get it's shit together and offer free public tuition by then.

465	Paraguay promises to be a 100% renewable Bitcoin (BTC) mining giant	1626521977.0	2343	"Of course they will. Kinda easy. They have only hydroelectric power and 75% is sold to Brazil dirty cheap.
Better to put that excessive energy into crypto mining…
tldr; Paraguay has passed a law aimed at building a Bitcoin mining industry. It is the second country in America to provide a legal framework for bitcoin and in particular BTC mining. The law does not exempt minors whose computing power is below a certain threshold. The aim of the maneuver is to propose tariffs for electricity higher than normal in order to fill the public coffers.

This is good for Bitcoin:
> 
> “It’s a safe bet that Paraguay will be active in the field of BTC mining. In 2018, the country’s two large hydroelectric dams produced three times its electricity needs. Energy is therefore exported to its neighbors and brings in more than $ 2 billion per year, or 1/4 of its total exports and 7% of its GDP. The two dams located on the Rio Paraná are held 50/50 with the border countries: the Itaipu dam on the Brazilian border, and that of Yacyretá on the Argentinian border.“
> 
> In other words, it is around 30 TWh/year of renewable energy that Paraguay could theoretically redirect to Bitcoin mining. That is to say a little less than half of the energy power currently required for the entire BTC network.
> 
> Paraguay’s timing is perfect given that the mining machines that were in China (half of the world’s fleet) are now looking for a base!
> 
> “Today, we are proud to present this project which will offer considerable economic, financial and fiscal benefits for our population through the consumption and use of our renewable energy, mainly from our hydroelectric plants of Itaipú and Yacireta. The country has huge surpluses that we will use for the benefit of the Paraguayan state,” said Rejala during the presentation of the project."

486	Taxation Is Theft	1601748281.0	2221	"There is nothing wrong with taxes. It's what is done with the taxes that is the problem. And OP's post has nothing to do with bitcoin because you should be paying what ever tax you owe on your bitcoin.
Of all the ways governments intrude in our lives I find taxes to be among the least concerning.

It would be rare for me to encounter a challenge that I wouldn't prefer to just magically convert into a small (or even substantial) percentage of the profits of whatever endeavour I was looking to accomplish. 

Sometimes-- often even-- the taxes are ineptly constructed and cause additional damage through the market distortions they create, sometimes their construction excessively invades your privacy or autonomy. But these issues are separate from describing taxes as 'theft'.  Similarly, states often spend money in wasteful or distorting ways that are worthy of criticism, and some taxes are the product of corruption that privately enrich some at the expense of others. But again, these aren't fundamental problems with taxation in the abstract.

Show me a person who has locked themselves in a hermetically sealed box, imposing no costs on other people and benefiting not at all from shared infrastructure or resources, entirely self-sufficient in apparent contradiction of the Second Law, and I'll be happy to listen to their argument that taxation is theft.

But absent extreme isolation like that we all live in a shared system where we impose costs on others and endure costs from others, like it or not. We all benefit from shared infrastructures that exist as natural monopolies (or nearly so), not just directly but indirectly as well-- you're able to read my words because I receive electrical service that depends on countless amounts of tax funded infrastructure (as well as other kinds of public takings, such as right-of-ways), not to mention that someone taught both of us to read and write-- almost certainly paid for by taxes since the benefits of a broadly literate society are tremendous.

Taxation, in the abstract, is just an efficient and clean way of codifying and sharing costs-- or at least ""efficient and clean"" compared to many alternatives.  Refusing to take a pragmatic view of taxation is as childish as the person in the video. I think that sort of faux-principled position gets in the way of making real improvements against wasteful spending, public costs which could be handled equally well privately, inequitable or invasive systems of taxation, etc.

Ultimately most people realize that taxes are extremely *practical*. Some ways of constructing taxes are better than others, and like any other tool they can be used inappropriately or excessively.  But where a true externality exists or a naturally shared resource needs to be funded a tax of some kind can be one of the most efficient and least intrusive way of dealing with it. If we can't admit that taxes are sometimes an okay tool then we can't have a discussion about how they could be changed to be better without leaving the realm of practicality.

Moreover, the most natural practical alternative to taxation is outright printing money, which is worse in almost every respect-- except perhaps how dangerously invisible it is to the public.
This is r/bitcoin not r/libterterian. There may be some overlap in that venn diagram but bitcoin can overlap with many ideologies.

This demonstration of taxes to a child is flat misleading to the child and those watching it. Memeducation at peak propoganda"

People often say, ""Look at the news, the world is becoming more and more violent!"" But one need only reflect for a moment to realize that 99.999% of all people on this planet interact peacefully in 99.999% of encounters. It is a common fallacy of cognition to exaggerate rare risks that are extremely dangerous[1]. In short, the peaceful, decentralized masses really do outweigh the efforts of bad actors, however well organized they may be. The key is to enable that decentralized mass to coalesce into a single point mass (such as the blockchain) that cannot be moved by bad actors.

Bitcoin consumes so much energy because it uses a fully mechanical & digital process to ascertain truth. It doesn't rely on the authority of anyone.  
It isn't a more energy-intensive way of doing consumer payments; it's a less energy-intensive way of achieving consensus than **war**.  
  
All attempts to compare bitcoin energy consumption with banks, consumer payment technologies, central banks, or gold completely miss the point of bitcoin's real opportunity cost. Bitcoin doesn't replace these & they can, in principle, coexist with bitcoin.  
     
Bitcoin replaces the need for strangers to have to be subject to the same government & central bank in order to trade internationally, which necessitates **one government** imposing its will on the rest of the world, which can only be done with **war**.
Of course it uses less.

Fyi, the article doesn't seem very clear to me.

I think most people will assume this means ""make legal tender"", but it only says legalize.

Apparently crypto is currently illegal for banks in Iran:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality\_of\_bitcoin\_by\_country\_or\_territory

>Financial institutions are not allowed by central bank to facilitate bitcoin transactions.\[13\]  
In April 2018, Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran  
 issued a statement banning the country's banks and financial   
institutions from dealing with cryptocurrencies, citing money laundering  
 and terrorism financing risks.\[77\]

522	Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, speaks from Mexico: “Bitcoin is better than gold”	1626043196.0	2049	"I've been telling people this fact for many years:  

Gold is expensive to store securely.

Gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely, especially large amounts.

Gold is heavy, it takes up space.

You can't walk very far carrying a lot of gold. You can't swim at all with more than a few coins of gold.

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.

Meanwhile...  

Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.

Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.

Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.

Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.

Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Robbers, pirates, corrupt cops, soldiers, etc. won't know you own any (unless you tell them), and they cannot merely kill you and take your Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can be sent across the Internet.

Nobody spends gold as money these days.

People have been using Bitcoin as money, and as a store of value.
tldr; Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has said that Bitcoin is better than gold. ""Gold is limited and you have to look for it; Bitcoin is the most amazing mathematical miracle,"" he added. However, he clarified that he is not an investor in Bitcoin, adding, ""I don't invest in Bitcoin but I believe in it for the future."" This comes as Mexico has issued severe warnings against cryptocurrencies.

*This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR.*
They aren’t competitors. I own gold for security, I own Bitcoin for price appreciation.

I’d never sell my gold any more than I’d cancel my health insurance. This notion that bitcoin and gold are competitive assets is nothing more than FUD. Goldbugs and Bitcoin holders want the same thing."
523	Selling Bitcoin and trying to buy back in cheaper is like getting off a train and trying to outrun it to the next station.	1614797249.0	2032	"True... but this train is also known to randomly shift in to reverse and floor it every once in a while.
Yes!  

&#x200B;

The fact is, market timing has a nearly 100% failure rate in the long run. Yes, a few people get lucky. Most go broke. This is factual.

Meanwhile, the long term average ROI for holding Bitcoin is about 100% per year. (Holding means no day trading, no trying to time the dips/peaks, aka, no selling.)

So, many of us here want you and others to enjoy the amazing 100% per year long term average ROI, compounded for years and years. We want you to hold your Bitcoins and grow fabulously rich as a result. We don't want you to gamble foolishly in a manner with a nearly 100% failure rate.

""All the indicators indicate that the Bitcoin hype will probably continue for the time being,"" states economist Rüdiger Zudamm. ""It makes a lot of people rich without lifting a finger.""
It only becomes critical when you decide to finally get Bitcoins in order to also benefit from the hype. Because immediately afterwards, the bubble will burst suddenly and the course will plunge into the abyss.

Sure he has the luxury of thinking about this stuff on a grand scale because he is not burdened by breaking his back 9-5 to pay rent, but his logic is applicable to anyone regardless of what wealth they're holding. And he is busting his ass talking and educating people for free as much as he can, transferring his knowledge to everyone regardless of money or status. Kudos to that guy.
That is beautiful hearing Saylor say it
I don’t mind paying taxes on a 401K job. I do however mind paying taxes on money that I earn through investments. They should be 100% untaxed. I took all the risk of losing my money, therefore I should receive all of the reward. The government steps in when you earn money through investment and says “our gains”, but when you lose everything the loss falls squarely on the shoulders of the investor. The government is over reaching and the people who fail to see that are part of the problem."

592	After selling btc at 10k 🤦‍♂️	1604077874.0	1747	"Here are a few helpful tips so that 'future you' doesn't hate 'current you':


*You panic sold during a drop.*

Investing is best divorced from emotion. Relax, breathe, have a plan for buying *and* selling. Consider switching to dollar cost averaging, maybe stop looking at the charts every hour. Consider switching to decaf. 


*You panic bought during a peak, and it's now gone down.*

This is not a big deal, just be patient. Buy and hodl. Resist the temptation to day trade in much the same way you'd resist the temptation to cover yourself in chum and go diving. 


*You believed the marketing hype on some rando website about this 'Turing complete blockchain computer, privacy coin, Bitcoin killer' and bought a bunch 'just in case it takes off.'*

Shitcoin hazing almost a rite of passage for newbs at this point. Trade the alts for Bitcoin at a loss and feel better about having learned a valuable lesson. Yes, your intuition is correct, that new 'DEFI' thing is a rebranded altcoin/ICO scam, designed to part the naive from their Bitcoins. 


*You shorted Bitcoin on Bitfinex with 20x leverage because Jim Cramer said Bitcoin is overbought and absolutely will crash in the next week or two. You lost four grand, and are pulling out the credit card to 'make up the loss.'*

Consider getting out of cryptocurrency altogether. Use your remaining balance to see a therapist about your gambling addiction before buying more Bitcoin. 


*Bought something with Bitcoin?*

Hey it's money, you buy things with money. Just remember to rebuy an equal amount on an exchange.
HODL Bitcoin no matter what.
Wait till it hits 1 mill year 2027... you will buy it again then.. sell low buy high that’s our Motto and you are doing right bro"
593	Over the past weeks we heard a lot of news coming from China about another Bitcoin ban, miners gone offline and it was reported that the Chinese State Council was cracking down on mining...	1622450773.0	1741	"Good luck. How exactly do they plan on finding all the miners ?
Jan - March we heard thick FUD around China controlling bitcoin. Now, April - May we're hearing FUD around China banning bitcoin. Whatever fits their narrative and yet Bitcoin still doesn't care.
Well, we all know how reliable the CCP controlled ""news"" is (think MSNBC or CNN).

My guess?  This is an intentional ruse to drive down the price so they buy as much as they can during this 30%-35% dip/correction and make trillions when BTC rights itself and grows at its normal rate.

My quasi-educated guess is that BTC will be worth near 6 figures ($) by New Years Eve."

Even as someone who is completely in on Bitcoin, this line of thinking or just ""justifying"" the issue of energy consumption is not only unconvincing, I even think it's so dumb it makes me ashamed and a bit embarrassed some fellow Bitcoiner would ever use that to defend their sats.

And even if I'm the moron here because everyone thinks it's a good ""argument"", what if we have another price doubling or quadrupling and the energy consumption goes once again up with it? Since it's ""half the energy"" now, isn't it then twice the energy once a quadrupling happens and turns into a argument against Bitcoin because the entire Banking system is now more efficient? This is just stupid (in my opinion)
tldr; Bitcoin mining actually uses less energy than traditional banking, a new study claims. Bitcoin mining only uses half the energy that the traditional banking system does, according to Galaxy Digital Mining. Gold mining also uses up to twice the amount of energy of the bitcoin version, the study added. The study comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla would no longer take bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles.

Venezuelan living in America, but still in contact and visit almost every year. Minimum wage is way under $1 a day. Inflation almost cant be measured in percentage. See this number: 10000000000%.

Ok this  is probably a dumb line of thought but what's stopping banks from selling fake bitcoin to customers? Like just... Show them in a cute UI that they've got 0.2BTC, but... How do you really know it's actual bitcoin if you can never transfer it out? Can the bank prove that they actually have that amount in a wallet somewhere?

They could create ""locked bitcoin"" that's pegged to the price of the real BTC on the blockchain that you can never take custody of and gullible newbies would be none the wiser. Banks may not have enough real bitcoin, but they would have enough fiat to pay people for ""bitcoin"".

I feel like I'm missing something obvious here but I have such a low opinion of banks and governments these days that I'm overly suspicious of everything they do."

There’s definitely an argument for doing it this way. You might miss out of some gains, but you have to start somewhere and averaging out your purchases helps weather the dips. Plus, after seeing a 400% gain, it’s easier to keep buying more. Since it has a minimal impact on my average price.

Also among other factors. Mortgage rates are at historic lows \~2.67% which translates into more demand for mortgages which translates into more demand for houses which raises the prices since people (not just people but institutions like Blackrock and Blackstone too) are out bidding each other to try and lock in the cheap rates. Also banks would rather give money to people that are buying actual assets (real estate, cars, yachts) than to give it to a startup or a business because they are considered high risk so the real estate/auto markets are being flooded with money created out of thin air (aka credit, aka debt) which is contributing to the housing speculative bubble really.

It takes about 2 years to process seized assets and the 36 BTC was converted to Swedish Krona (SEK) 2021.

**Rehypothecation**: Look at the price of gold; it has been artificially suppressed via ""paper gold"". Search, ""physical gold vs paper gold"". ETFs open the door for evil people to suppress the price of Bitcoin by selling Bitcoins that don't exist, or, if you prefer, selling the same Bitcoin to many clients (dozens, hundreds), all at the same time. Don't be quick yell ""hooray for Bitcoin ETFs.""

**Government confiscation**: As the US dollar collapses (along with every other fiat currency), it will reach a point where they decide they ""need"" some money with value, to pay the military, for example. They'll decide they ""need"" to confiscate Bitcoins (and probably gold, too). The only Bitcoins they'll be able to confiscate will be those in held in custody, such as ETFs, exchanges, GBTC, etc. When this happens, those who have been beating the ""Not your keys, not your Bitcoins,"" drum will be vindicated."

> One of the main advantages of Schnorr signatures is that they’re able to take multiple keys inside a complex Bitcoin transaction and produce a single unique signature. This means that the signatures from the multiple parties involved in the transaction can be “aggregated” into a single Schnorr signature. This is known as signature aggregation.

> Reduced amount of data to be transferred and stored on the blockchain.

729	#Bitcoin didn’t pump because of the Amazon “news” from some random website. Bitcoin pumped due to shorts getting liquidated. Don’t let the FUD in.	1627332100.0	1366	"Nobody knows either way, yours is merely a theory.

The shorts only got liquidated because the price moved up significantly in the first place. Highly leveraged shorts and longs amplify the volatility in both directions, but this is true in any given day.    


A large buy or many buys can eat through a sell wall, and vice versa. It may be a lot of people believed the amazon ""news"", it may be one single big player did a large spot buy instead of doing like Saylor and spreading across days,  it may be the stars just aligned and for some reason a large amount of people were orange pilled lately and decided to buy in the last 24 hours.  Any and all of these options (or others you may want to imagine) can make a movement in price that compounded with leveraged trading has moved the market significantly.
Now the long is getting liquidated. What a strange day

You sell when you’re satisfied, not when volatility scares the shit out of you. Panic selling is not a strategy, so don’t do it. Just like everyone’s says: HODL. It’s literally that simple

Hello.   As a Newbie to Bitcoin, I'd like to share an opinion.  Maybe its born out of laziness, maybe out of ignorance.   I understand that bitcoin is complex and requires attentive study to fully understand.  

&#x200B;

But to attract the normies such as myself, we could really use a more simple ""how to"" guide.    What I mean is, a true dummy proof explanation that a golden retriever could understand.  

As someone who doesn't know and doesn't understand pretty much ANYTHING at all about bitcoin, I can't find one single resource that quickly explains ALL of the following in detail.  By the way, these are based on my own experience as a newbie.  

1) How to buy bitcoin on an exchange and what you will need.  What happens to this BTC after you buy it?  What kind of mark up you will pay, AND how much you will pay to transfer this BTC onto a different wallet from the online exchange.  

2) Best way to store larger amounts (hardware wallet?) so they are secure.  

3) Transfer fees and what they mean.   Which wallets have what transfer fees.  As a newbie, I think after using 26 dollar in USD to buy bitcoin, I ended up with 16 USD worth of BTC in my wallet when all was said and done.   I understand there are cheaper ways to buy, just saying from the start the entire thing seemed like a scam.   And I'm sure I WAS scammed by the exchange.  But, Buyer beware and everything.   Now I'm doing a test transfer with low fees, and It seems like the electrum wallet is taking .2 mbtc?  There goes another 6-7 bucks just to transfer 30-35 bucks?

4) How have transfer fees changed over time and what is the limit?  For Eg. Can one SAT be transferred?  How would the fee be paid?  If I choose the lowest transfer fee on electrum wallet, how long does it take?   

5) When No new bitcoin can be created, will transfer fees increase even more?   What will it mean for transactions once bitcoins can no longer be ""mined""?  

In short, I understand the need to research and put in time.  But some kind of quick guide ""Here's how to safely and quickly get 1000 USD into BTC"" would be a great for the lazy newbs like myself.
I’ve had cash app for a while and it says that back in 2019 I had bought 0.00227993 BTC for $20.35 and was just wondering what that would equate to today seeing that BTC was 7k at the time. Sorry if it’s an annoying question (btw I’m a believer now)"

He also said that since his starlink constellation will provide everyone (who can afford it) internet, that we should just scale the base layer of the crypto to meet those specifications. Completely tone deaf to what it means for Bitcoin to maintain its decentralized nature.

Just because some middle class family in the US can afford great hardware and internet services, does not mean that citizens of developing countries have those resources. If the internet is to have its own currency standard, [then it must stay neutral](https://youtu.be/EiW4lKrMXQ4) to the resources of those that make up the overwhelming majority of the world.
Elon is trying to fit bitcoin into his agenda. First he creates the energy fud in a blatant attempt to manipulate bitcoin miners to buy teslas carbon credit and now he wants to use bitcoin to help out starlink. Bitcoin is it’s own thing. It won’t change to become something to help Elon’s companies

1/ This is massive news for Bitcoin. An insurance company buying Bitcoin from its general account is one of the biggest stamps of approval possible.

2/ The funds in an insurance company's general account are usually invested very conservatively, as these funds are used to pay policy holder claims.

3/ By investing in Bitcoin, MassMutual has effectively signaled that Bitcoin is considered safe and liquid enough for the largest, most conservative institutions in the world to make an allocation.

4/ If I had to guess, MassMutual management probably realized that as yields trend towards zero, it is very risky to NOT own any Bitcoin.

I don't think it's reasonable to argue that bitcoin should equal all the world's wealth if it becomes the world's dominant payment system. One would expect it to approximately equal the total of all the world's currencies and payments systems, so all fiat, gold, perhaps 1/2 of the values of credit card companies, and some additional fraction of the banking sector. You might also expect since fraction of low return investments line real estate, bonds,  and derivatives to be eaten by bitcoin. All the world's wealth is a massive over estimate tho, which should be obvious since money isn't the only wealth out there. There's an estimated $1.6- 2.1 quadrillion of wealth in the world: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization-2020/

Even so, perhaps $200 trillion of that could be eaten by bitcoin, up to $700 trillion if half of the derivatives market is eaten.

792	"Elon in interview: ""I'm late to the party, but I am a supporter of Bitcoin... I think Bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance."" (comments around 1hr mark in video)"	1612162257.0	1223	"# Transcript:

\----------

This is my amateur transcript of his full thoughts from the interview.  It's not exact (I left out the ""umms,"" pauses, etc, and might have missed a word or two), but I hope you find it helpful!

Alternatively, [here's a link](https://youtu.be/Cba53J1jyPM?t=3829) to the part of the interview recording where he starts talking about crypto (around 1:03).

\----------

**Question from Sriram Krishnan:**

Elon, this is something you joked about, but I'm kind of curious to get your serious answer to this, which is: All things cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. You famously just changed your Twitter bio to just the Bitcoin logo and the word Bitcoin this week. What do you think of cryptocurrency, what do you think of Bitcoin, what do you think of other cryptocurrencies - love to get your take on the entire thing.""

**Elon's Response:**

(Laugh) Well, gotta watch what I say here, because some of these things can really move the markets.

So, first of all I should say that many friends of mine have tried to convince me to get involved in Bitcoin for a long time like, when it first just popped out there.

(unintelligible) he actually had Bitcoin, like a Bitcoin ""cake,"" a cake that had a Bitcoin symbol on it, and he fed me a slice of Bitcoin cake in 2013.

So, clearly I should have bought some Bitcoin 8 years ago. (laugh) Like, what more can people do? Jesus. Talk about being late to the party.

So I was a little slow on the uptake there. My apologies. But I - as I think about it a fair bit, I do at this point think Bitcoin is a good thing, and - so, I am a supporter of Bitcoin. Like I said, I'm late to the party but I'm a supporter of Bitcoin. And I think that Bitcoin is really on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people

So... I don't have a strong opinion on other cryptocurrencies. Occasionally I make jokes about Dogecoin, but they are really just meant to be jokes.

Dogecoin was made as a joke, to make fun of cryptocurrencies, obviously. But fate loves irony. And often, as (unintelligible) the most ironic, or most entertaining outcome is often most likely, and - arguably - the most entertaining outcome - the most ironic outcome - would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future.

(laughter)

\----------

After this they talked about the crypto scammers who targeted his Twitter account for a while, and then moved on to discussing Tesla.

Elon made these comments in an interview on the Clubhouse platform (interview mentioned on his Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355983231988862978?s=20)).
He's obviously got more to say than this if he's  changed his Twitter bio to just 'bitcoin'

you're wrong.  the market isn't responding to whatever fucking news you pretend.  

the market was already in indecision mode, and ready to move down.   

the avalanche isn't caused by that last snowflake. it's caused by all the snow that's been building up over time.
There are many signs a lot of people have no clue at all, the whole shitcoin market that still keeps going and is burning lots of money because people are gambling on a possible next bitcoin is just another..

No celebrity is a (bigger) hero in Bitcoin, not Elon Musk, not Michael Saylor, not Jack Dorsey, not [insert celebrity name here].

You, an ordinary user who either runs a node, or spends coins to support Bitcoin related businesses, or spreads the message, or shares its knowledge, or writes code or makes products related to Bitcoin, or mine Bitcoin, are a hero.
People need to realize that billionaires don’t want fiat to fail (not to say BTC holders do either).  They’re currently living in a system that massively favors them, and can see the oncoming BTC train that has the potential to fuck up their lives, unless they get on board.  But getting on board takes a huge leap of faith, as long as the current fiat system favors them as much as it does today.  Billionaires will do whatever it takes to maintain the status quo."

Completely unacceptable that a company charged with protecting my valuable encrypted property saw to it unscrupulous people who want to steal it have my direct line.
Well, the data leak doesn't really relate to the ledger devices does it... it's their internal system that had a breach, so actually we should complain about their internal data protection, or to the service provider who assisted them with IT security.  
I believe most people still use dropbox, facebook etc and they've had massive leaks as well

I love that proper conversation and change of opinion was still possible in 2010. Discussions were not motivated by political bias and ultimately ending in ad hominems, but by the actual will to learn and understand things.

It is so refreshing to look back at.
That was in 2010. Gold and BTC are energy wise more or less at par at about 130 TWh per year nowadays. If we measure the utility of both in their market cap, gold leads for now. But wee need to take into account other pollutants of gold mining, which is worse than that of BTC mining. But, OTOH, some gold is needed to mine BTC, so it is needed also."

Imagine having 10k bitcoins... I mean, someone surely has that many. But how does it even look in the interface on your wallet when you go to look what the value is in fiat lmao. You could only ever take 250k out at once on most exchanges. You could literally earn 250k every day and it'd still take nearly 7 years before your wallet runs dry.

What the hell would a bank even tell you if you started withdrawing 250k every day to your account from a crypto exchange? Would they just ban you outright? I can't even imagine how complicated filing taxes would be.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

\***1099K -** If you meet **all three of these** requirements, Coinbase will send you AND the IRS a copy of *1099-K*

1. You are a Coinbase Pro or Coinbase Prime customer
2. You executed 200 trades or more, whose total value is equal to or greater than $20,000\* (OR met your state’s 1099-K reporting thresholds)
3. You are subject to US taxes

\* *As of the 2020 tax year, Coinbase will not be issuing Form 1099-Ks for trades on Coinbase.* ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

**1099-MISC -**  If you meet **each of these three criteria**, both you and the IRS will be sent a copy of your *1099-MISC*.

1. Are a Coinbase.com customer
2. Received $600 or more in cryptocurrency from Coinbase Earn, USDC Rewards, and/or Staking in 2020
3. Are subject to US taxes

TL;DR - So basically if you earn lots of money thru interest/rewards, trade a whole bunch, and/or sell a whole bunch of crypto for lots of money, you should probably report it. If you just buy and hold. Nah...you don't report squat. xD
That makes sense because something that's not a taxable event is none of their business.
Why is the question worded the way it is on the 1040 then??   Obviously if you bought crypto and never sold... its not a taxable event.  But you definitely ""acquired a financial interest"" by buying...which anyone who can understand the English language would conclude that the answer to that question is YES.

Also if you purchased on an exchange, and just sent the coins to your own wallet, you automatically meet the ""send"" criterion in the question, even though thats not taxable.  So you'd answer yes.   But this tweet is apparently clarifying that the wording of the question doesn't matter... it seems they only want people answer yes if you realized a gain that would be taxable.

They wrote the question horribly.  If they only wanted people who owe taxes to answer Yes, they should have worded the question that way."

It's not really true though because there are key differences between censorship and moderation. r/Bitcoin probably doesn't moderate any more severely than r/btc does (they obviously ban lots of users and remove lots of posts). The key difference is that r/Bitcoin has very low tolerance for shitcoin spam, whereas r/btc is mostly about shitcoins but also includes a heavy anti-Bitcoin slant. Their whole 'censorship' argument was always just a marketing tactic intended to lure into their hole with false promises.

Truly historic.	1624896433.0	1099	"When the majority of the world were on a gold standard, China instead chose a silver standard. China switched to a gold standard in 1935 and by that time silver had already lost 78% of its value relative to gold.

China is making another silver mistake.

Edit - no idea why there's so much rare earth discussions in replies. Rare earth minerals are scarce, but do not have good stock to flow, so they wouldn't make good money regardless. You need a high stock (amount of the good in human hands) and low flow (amount yearly that gets added) to have hard money. This has historically been gold as the clear first place and silver in second. Bitcoin is currently about the same as gold and gets higher every halvening. China's reason for sticking with a silver standard was likely due to having control of silver mines, which allows them to control the minting of the money and essentially print money for themselves. Much like the Federal Reserve does today. For more in depth information on the history of money, go read The Bitcoin Standard.
This month's shout out goes to China, for selflessly helping bitcoin remove the last area of major centralisation in its network at her own loss, and the loss of her children and her children's children

882	Governments Planning a Global Coordinated Attack on Bitcoin from Next Month Onwards [Due Diligence]	1624363353.0	1082	"Hard to swallow pills for speculators in comfortable liberal democracies: Bitcoin was never meant to be compatible with the legacy finance system. These regulations are but the machinations of the very system Bitcoin seeks to disrupt. The unfortunate correlate is that the legacy system will fail in a non-subtle way before Bitcoin is accepted as the rational choice. This would indicate the process will be anything but smooth, especially in terms of market price discovery. If you believe in the legacy system's sustainability in the long term, you probably shouldn't speculate on Bitcoin. If you see this reaction as inevitable and predicted by the game theory built into the Bitcoin protocol, your conviction has probably increased.
Wow. OP takes the time to read technical articles and then summarize them for an audience that should be keenly interested in knowing what might happen to crypto regulation and he gets shit on for being a FUD ster?
Thanks OP …appreciate the write up
We are on a knifes edge between letting bitcoin be co-opted and absorbed into the oppressive financial system that runs the world now and letting it free us.

They will fight it the whole way, but it is literally our choice to submit and comply, or turn the tables on them and make them irrelevant. They have nothing of value to offer but the illusion of safety, their currencies are backed by nothing but violence and the threat of imprisonment.

The question is, how badly do people want to be free?

83 tonnes (\~91.5 tons) of gold: 4,909,450,000 USD 

83 tons (\~75.3 metric tonnes) of gold: 4,453,995,000 USD

$2 billion would be around 44.9% of that gold.

892	Using Applied Economics to Bitcoin and why it matters.	1609974537.0	1071	"I would love a detailed perspective written by someone who is educated in economics and finance. Take my upvote, and please write the next one with as much detail as you can bare to give us.
I focused on game theory when I studied economics in college. Bitcoin wins against every currency, asset, altcoin, and precious metal in the long run. Here is some game theory thinking for anyone interested:

It took 6,000 years to make an infinitely scarce asset where supply is permanently fixed as demand increases. This is unprecedented as anything that becomes a store of value has a game theory incentive from suppliers to enter the market and produce more of, diluting its value in the long run. Demand for Bitcoin is coming from bonds, stocks, real estate, gold, and currency seeking a store-of-value safe haven as the liquidity loops propping up these markets begin to collapse due to hyperinflation.

Once Bitcoin exists, it is impossible to recreate another infinitely scarce asset to kill Bitcoin. The reason being, c*reating an infinitely scarce asset to kill the first infinitely scarce asset is Catch-22*. By minting more of a different asset to achieve the narrative that it is more scarce than the first asset that cannot be minted more of, your asset is already inferior to the first asset. The reason being, by minting an infinitely scarce asset, you are creating more of stuff even if the supply is capped at a fixed amount.

It is basically the inverse of a central bank with the same cancerous issue. Central banks are stuck with one currency but they can mint as much of it as possible - Blockchain engineers are stuck with a single supply cap but can mint as many new currencies as possible. Same problem, different flavor. This is why Bitcoin is so unusual from a game theory perspective, once the protocol exists as an infinitely scarce asset, it eats every other asset (including other infinitely scarce protocols) that behaves as a store of value in the long run. Everything that tries to compete with Bitcoin will lose since there is no ""second"" store-of-value investment that comes after Bitcoin.

Afghanistan is the size of France but only had 50km of paved roads when the US army entered. France has almost 1.6 million km of paved roads by comparison. Afghanistan has a population of 36 million. Most people in rural Afghanistan (85% of the population) don’t even know 9/11 happened nor have they ever had internet access. The average income in Afghanistan is about $500USD per year. It would cost about $5m USD to pave 1 mile of road in Afghanistan due to the logistics of the terrain, and threat from conflict. So to add to OP’s point, cryptocurrency is the last thing they need to worry about at this point.
I would imagine the point they're making is that *in a  Bitcoin hegemonic world* the opportunity for war is less because governments won't be able to so easily print fiat to fund their wars in the first place.

Also in a world of decentralized cloud finance, you could more easily pick up where you left off versus centralized banks just collapsing with all of your savings gone in an instant.

Based on the manifesto you linked, if satoshi was a true cypherpunk it would follow that one of his primary motives be to retain privacy. Ironically, Bitcoin is far from private, and it seems that the governing bodies are focused on creating processes that more easily track users via the open blockchain. Regulation a la KYC through exchanges has exposed a large part of the user base of Bitcoin and many dont realize this. There is no question that governing bodies haven’t already begun developing an even more advanced platform that easily maps wallet addresses with customer identities and follows the flow of Bitcoin transactions between users. Such a development would render the privacy among Bitcoin users to be far inferior to basic cash. Think about how criminals have been caught through tracking the blockchain— and this was early days. I own a lot of btc, more than most people, but I won’t say it’s a solution to the issue of privacy as outlined in that manifesto, unless some sort of off-chain solution is created to obfuscate transactions.

929	Central Banks intend to use FedCoins to monitor and control all money	1625732888.0	1022	"[deleted]
This stuff here should scare the entire population to put at least a little bit of cash to Bitcoin. In the history of the world all fiet currencies have eventually died. A coin based off of one is no different.
SUMMARY: Statement by Head of BIS explaining plans for replacing all cash.

“Cross Border Payments - A Vision of the Future”, by [Agustín Carstens](https://www.bis.org/author/agust%C3%ADn_carstens.htm), Bank Of International Settlements, BIS General Manager.

“With CBDCs (i.e. Central Bank Digital Currencies, ""Fed Coins""), we intend to establish the equivalence with cash.... For example, in cash, we don’t know - for example - who’s using a $100 bill today... we don’t know who’s using a 1000 Peso bill today. A key difference is the Central Banks will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of Central Bank liability \[i.e. ""Money"", ""Cash"", Issued Currency\]. And also, we will have the technology to enforce that... that makes a huge difference to what cash is.”"

[2016 DAO hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum_Classic#The_DAO_bailout) \- In 2016 faulty Ethereum smart contract coding (an issue with an application built on the blockchain, not the blockchain itself) led to $50 million in funds being stolen. The Ethereum Foundation disregarded ""code is law"" and forked the blockchain to rollback these changes. Essentially, the blockchain itself was bent to accommodate human error. An unforked version of Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, still exists but has a 100th of the market cap and is prone to 51% attacks. [Ethereum also had a premine,](https://www.coindesk.com/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine) meaning that a lot of Ether was generated at the push of a button.

There are obviously many other cryptocurrencies, but ultimately all of them were in reaction to the hype around Bitcoin. Bitcoin was and is a project in cryptography and decentralized money, altcoins use hype to gain investors so that their creators can cash out.

975	"""About a quarter of El Salvador’s citizens live in the US and last year, they sent home more than $6 billion in remittances."""	1624107769.0	968	"$6B

What will be the volume impact once Salvadorans learn that don't need to send their money through Western Union?

Edit: Also, keep in mind, this law compels all businesses in El Salvador to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. That's a significant milestone.
This is one of the largest arguments for use that people seem to still not properly grasp because we don't see it. Imagine you live in a country where the economy has collapsed. You immagrate to a new county for opportunity and begin working countless hours every week to send money home to your loved ones. You get your first paycheck pay your bills and send off 100 bucks to your family back home. Knowing 100 US will be a good amount of money for your family you send it. Now enters the problems of our current financial system. It's gonna take 2-10 days to reach your loved ones. Anywhere from 3-10 institutions need to be involved in this and of course the fees. For most investors no one cares about the fees 20 here 30 there, but when your family depends on that 100 USD and 20%-50% disappears in remittance fees the picture becomes a little more clear.
tldr; The World Bank has rejected El Salvador’s request to become the first nation in the world to implement bitcoin as legal tender. The country is keeping the US dollar also as its official currency, but President Nayib Bukele has touted the cryptocurrency's potential to cut down on transaction fees for Salvadorans overseas. About a quarter of El Salvador's citizens live in the US.

A guy I work with just complained about how he sold his Bitcoin for a loss, and when I asked why he would ever sell for a loss, told me “because it’s down $20,000!” 

The ignorance of some people to only start paying attention to btc when it’s at the highest it’s ever been, watch it go back down and claim it’s crashing. Imagine if we looked at TSLA or any other stock through that lens lol
I really think people should try owning shares in a company for a while before jumping in to crypto. It gives you a far better understanding of how markets are meant to be. If you think buying and selling and buying all within a few months and making hundreds of percent profit are normal, then you are mistaken. If you don't have the patience to put your money in crypto and then wait a few years then you probably shouldn't be investing in it.
This is why they are called paper hands; Because they fold and crumble under pressure. 

The phrase “everyone buys at the price they deserve” is accurate. I contemplated these words and realized how early we still are. It also highlights that it’s best to stack and DCA and sacrifice for as long as possible. 

Consider this: you’re telling your buddy all about the importance behind permissionless money and the literal freedom it brings to your life and promotes around the world and he says “Yeah but it’s really expensive...” A month passes and after an icon, who’s popularity and economic position are questionable at best, takes the opportunistic que and exacerbates a predictable market dip into a 50% correction. Being the empathetic person you are, you phone up your friend. Excited to tell him how lucky he is to be able to get in at a price few even thought would be available again confusion sucks the wind from your sails as he rudely interjects your news with “why the fuck would I want to buy something that just crashed...”

These people can’t break the grip the whole macro web of fiat has on their perspective.  Being told how to think and how great their fiat is like a warm embrace to them. Change, they fear, is cold and unforgiving; and they may be right. But to resist change is to stagnate and ultimately perish early."

That would be wise,but ONLY if you get the heck out of RH.
Use Coinbase, Binance, KRAKEN..... anything but RH!
I sold all my RH BTC shares and tried to withdraw after the settlement period. They are not letting me withdraw, showing error messages, saying my account has ""restrictions"" for no good reason... seriously f*ck those guys. Good luck getting your $$ out, friend. Customer service is down to auto-replies letting you know that you are ""in line"" to get help, sometimes soon. They haven't responded to me in 5 days at this point. Sketcky AF.

987	You guys made this possible. This week we delivered 2,579 lbs (1.17 tons) of food to people in need in Venezuela. Thank you.	1620493868.0	957	"Not this again, omg why are all you falling for this.

As I can see in the picture, the bags that the people got have 1kilo ^(2.2 pounds) bags of pasta, rice and cornmeal and Black beans, nothing else

The prices of this items, per kilo, in venezuela, are around 1$, you can check someprices of those exact products seen on the picture here:

* Rice: Brand in the pictures is ""Mary"", the rice in venezuela is sold by tiers, the one in the pictures is 2nd tier ^(worse than 1st tier) a.k.a ""tradicional"" one, with the orange package, the price of the tier 1 of the same brand is 1.16$ per kilo, and has a red package, you can check price here: https://www.promarketlatino.com/tienda/ver/2004 If you need to see the website for the rice you can confirm that the item in the donation is 2nd tier one that is cheaper than 1.16, you can find that one for around 0.8$ PER KILo. https://www.alimentosmary.com/productos/

* better brand cornmeal, the one in the pictures is a terrible cheaper brand, this brand is way better and cost 0,98 https://www.promarketlatino.com/tienda/ver/245 the one that was in the donations is so bad that no online retailer sells it, the name for it is ""Harina santa lucia"", it cost 0.65$ the only online retailer that I found was in a ebay like site: https://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ve/MLV-578267601-oferta-harina-de-trigo-sta-lucia-por-bultos-20-kg-_JM#position=1&search_layout=stack&type=item&tracking_id=4a920ebb-cc6a-4695-a894-dc0499a69b0c thats 13$ per a 20kilos case (20 1 kilo bags)

* The pasta in the pictures is a totally uknown brand, and my guess is that is also a really cheap brand of pasta, you can check pasta results here: https://www.promarketlatino.com/search?query=pasta and you will see nothing like it, it's probally same case of cornmeal, is a bad brand that is not sold online, but the average price of a kilo of good pasta is 1.5$, I will call that this girl used a 1.25$ kilo pasta, since thats the price of the bad one.

* Black beans: There is a lot of local brand of black beans, they are around 1.5$ per kilo in premium ones, 1$ per kilo on bad ones, lets average 1.25$

so a resume:

* rice: 0.8$ 
* pasta: 1.25
* blackbeans: 1.25
* cornmeal: 0.65

that puts the kilo of food with an average of 0.98$ and it sounds correct, as I remember correctly, venezuelans joke about 1 kilo of food = 1 dollar. And keep in mind that I am using online prices (usually some % more expensive than  buying in normal stores)

**This person is bragging that she gave away 1170 kilos of food, at 1 dollar each kilo, thats 1170 dollars.**

#**She received over 6k USD in donations, only in their public chains one, we can't even see how many private donations she got in other sides.**

#**PLEASE STOP GIVING MONEY TO THIS DIY VENEZUELAN CHARITIES, THEY ARE MOSTLY A SCAM**

**ABUSING PEOPLE THAT RANDOMLY TAKES PICTURES OF OTHERS FOR GIVING THEM SOME BAG OF FOOD THAT IN TOTAL COST 1K USD WHILE GETTING MORE THAN 6K, ITS BAD**

**IF YOU WANNA REALLY HELP SOME REAL CHARITY IN VENEZUELA GO HERE AND PICK A REAL, VERIFIED CHARITY https://www.globalgiving.org/search/?size=25&nextPage=1&sortField=sortorder&selectedCountries=00venezu&loadAllResults=true**

**I KNOW IS NOT CRYPTO, BUT A LOT OF THEM HAVE INSTAGRAM PAGES/WEBSITES, ETC, WHERE YOU CAN FIND THAT THEY HAVE OTHER WAYS OF DONATION, THEY MIGHT EVEN HAVE WALLETS FOR CRYPTO DONATIONS IN THEIR SOCIAL NETWORKS, JUST PICK A NAME FROM HERE, ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS ACTUALLY CHECK THEY ARE LEGIT AND APPROVED IN GLOBALGIVING, AND GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM IN HOW TO GIVE THEM CRYPTO, MOST OF THEM ARE FAMILIAR WITH CRYPTO ALREADY**

Accredited investors basically means it will be offered to other funds focused on technology, hedge funds, maybe some mutual funds with flexible mandates.

As someone who has worked for Apple. I wouldn’t suggest it. Don’t rock the boat by making a big deal. You’ll more likely be let go, or not get promoted in the future. 

I’d suggest just politely to send some emails raising the suggestion and why you think it’s a great idea. 

But honestly the chances of it happening are almost zero…. They won’t change shit for a couple people.
The amount of paperwork that would result from this would be so much that unless an overwhelming majority of employees advocated for this, there's simply no way.

This would involve the finance department, HR, legal, then they would need to consult the Tax consultants, the auditors...

And then put policies in writing...

>The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a study on delayed gratification in 1972 led by psychologist Walter Mischel, a professor at Stanford University.[1] In this study, a child was offered a choice between one small but immediate reward, or two small rewards if they waited for a period of time. During this time, the researcher left the room for about 15 minutes and then returned. The reward was either a marshmallow or pretzel stick, depending on the child's preference. In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores,[2] educational attainment,[3] body mass index (BMI),[4] and other life measures.[5] A replication attempt with a sample from a more diverse population, over 10 times larger than the original study, showed only half the effect of the original study. The replication suggested that economic background, rather than willpower, explained the other half.[6][7]
Couldn't you say the same about any other investment?
But you have to admit that more marshmallows later is not 100% guaranteed in real life.  Time preference of money.  Just because most people err on the side of instant gratification doesn’t necessarily mean you shouldn’t err on the side of caution."
