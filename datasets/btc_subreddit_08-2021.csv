this is the first video that makes me want to buy a reddit award to give you
Are there any limits to the American Pantomime?"
1	This is just gem	1621697335.0	1532	"Can we have a fact check here?

According to the FED website ([https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/)) there are USDm 2,169,173 (2.169trillion) in circulation as of May 16th 2021.

On December 25th 2020 ([https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20191226](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20191226)) there were USDm 2,086,909 in circulation.

Did it increase. Of course it did, but it did no increase by 25% in the last 6 months. It increased by 4%. Which still is a lot... Don't get me wrong. But you shouldn't just believe any memes.

Nonetheless. On December 26th 2019 ([https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20191226](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20191226)) there were USDm 1,802,362 in circulation. So in the last approximately 1.5 years it increased by a whopping 20%!

~~EDIT: Why would you downvote facts? Cause they don't fit the circle jerk? By all means. Check them yourselves or correct them with sources.~~

EDIT2: thank you for your updates and information!
Spoiler: this shitcoin will probably mine another 25%-100% in the next 12 months.

Interesting.

That is why we need DeFi.
They delisted GME, not GSE, you dum dum."
4	Elon Musk on Bitcoin Cash: ‚ÄúFair point‚Äù	1616662418.0	1204	"Great to see Elon at least acknowledge Kim's point. He holds huge amount of sway with swaths on people. His opinion counts. This may at least make a few more people learn about BCH and be pleasantly surprised to find out that Cryptocurrency is not just a highly speculative asset for the rich!
All the maxi hate in that thread.  Didn't take them long to turn on him did it.
Well I think we‚Äôve all been waiting for this. This is why it‚Äôs important to have someone like Kim on our side. He can get the ear of someone like Elon, who has the ear of everyone."

That was a better time. When the goal of crypto was free trade buying and selling whatever we wanted, and the banks were the enemies.

Now CNBC talks about crypto more than stocks, and people dream of lambos more than freedom.
The only reason why BTC, and ALL crypto, is at where it is today, is because there were people like you guys trading 1000 BTC back in the day for a weed and a 2 pizzas.

You paved the way for crypto to become legit, and I, and the future, thank you.

You are heroes, truly. Don't regret anything."
8	Buying a Tesla with BTC	1617190417.0	940	"BTC is anagram of TBC (To Be Confirmed).
Crypto app? Wtf is that? The fact this guy says crypto app shows me he has no idea what he is doing.
Am I the only one thinking stuff like this unfortunately needs to happen more often for people to wake up? Even if BCH takes of, they would still cling to their hopes of ""BTC worlds best everything"" until their hopes and dreams are crushed and they start thinking?"
9	Friendly reminder that the LiteCoin ($36) founder sold 100% of his coins as it ran up to $300 while wearing a HODL shirt for video interviews.	1622473285.0	832	"Why are we spending time trying to discredit other cryptos? Who cares what litecoin does
Litecoin is a copy of BTC with slightly different parameters. No revolution here...

10	Bullish	1623012367.0	808	"All of these headlines about El Salvador confirming #Bitcoin as legal tender are fake, and misleading.

This is only a proposal and hasn‚Äôt even been sent to Congress to be voted on yet. 

El Salvador is very corrupt and the chances of this bill being approved are slim.

Except you pay tax on currency gains, and in most places at a regular tax rate, instead of the nice capital gains rate.
That was clear? 
Why else should there be a difference between legal currency and not legal currency?"

> [In February 2015, Ulbricht was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics by means of the internet.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht)

There. Now people can stop arguing over what he was actually convicted of.

I personally feel that there were/are net positive effects from the Silk Road and copycat sites. I also feel that Roger is being his usual over-simplified self by phrasing it as ‚Äúcreating a website‚Äù. 

Ross knew that he was potentially aiding much more sinister criminals, and he knew that he could be facilitating serious crimes. 

The chat logs showed him debating whether the site should restrict what substances could be sold. He noted that Cyanide has some legitimate non-homicidal uses, but also that people purchasing cyanide on the darknet were much more likely to be trying to kill someone. 

So even Ross understood that you couldn‚Äôt just create a peer-to-peer marketplace and take zero responsibility for what is sold there.
Ross is a hero, Derek a slime bag."
12	Elon Musk: ‚Äú Any crypto wallet that won‚Äôt give you your private keys should be avoided at all costs‚Äù	1612964090.0	797	"So custodial LN wallet are not the way to go?
The replies are hilarious, every no name wallet: ‚Äútake me Elon, take me!!!‚Äù
I still don't get it. I've been telling people about crypto since 2013.

Me: ""... the best part is you become your own bank. You have full control of what you own and how and when you want to send it. ""

Them: ""Cool. Fuck banks, right! So, Coinbase is good, right?""

Me: ""NO! Get your own wallet""

Them: ""uhh... to complicated and I'm scared I'll lose my password. I just want my money to double. So, Coinbase?"""
13	"""Are we the baddies?"" -r/bitcoin"	1614626843.0	775	"""never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake""
**Who here was a regular poster on BitcoinTalk.org and one day found their account password was ""incorrect"" and recovery email not matching?** Blockstream censored the most popular Bitcoin development channels in the shadiest of ways.

When the ""scaling"" debate was going on, only Blockstream proposed solutions like SegWit were allowed and during the ""scaling"" debate there was only an option to vote or not vote for SegWit... and when that didn't work, they made hats and threatened to split the Bitcoin network via UASF... after fudding for years how they must absolutely avoid a hard fork to avoid splitting the newtork.

For sure Blockstream and Bitcoin Core are the baddies. Oh and they're not done yet either. There's a recent campaign where aged account pro big blocks are getting mass reported and banned. Why? Because these accounts had many top level searchable threads full of history of debates proving the attacks and censorship was real.

This is one reason /u/BitcoinXio a moderator of /r/btc was banned with /u/nullc [constantly going after him](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ltorkm/bitcoin_cash_is_smart_money_heres_a_few_features/gp0a9lj/). He had a LOT of threads of important information that is no longer accessible and they wish to suppress this information.

14	"""Jackson Palmer, the co-creator of dogecoin, who left Twitter a while ago, returned briefly to post this Tweet. He was apparently so disgusted by Elon, he couldn't stay quiet."""	1620978142.0	767	"I am also disgusted by Elon Musk pump and dump antics.
I'm disappointed with Elon's constant gaming of the system, but I'm even more disappointed by the way that every coin seems to take a shit when BTC takes a shit.  Even coins on totally different blockchains serving totally different purposes.

There are too many idiots holding/dumping coins that are ruining it for everybody.
Elon playing is insulting to Maximalists. It shows that price don't mean shit when it comes to project legitimacy and the BTC maximalists are so butthurt that DOGE can perform better than BTC in price appreciation.

DOGE is hard proof that what BTC is holding on to is nothing and they are threatened.

I don't care what Elon's intentions are. He can do what he wants. He doesn't need praise. The fact that the whole industry's problems (BTC's inefficiency, memecoins on top, market manipulation) are brought into the spotlight instead of being ignored like the BTC maxis would want is something I like."
16	Got this from the IOTA subreddit	1615672488.0	756	"Truth hurts.

19	This meme aged like fine wine	1623643237.0	701	"This meme is terrible economics. Yes I know this is a crypto sub and so I'll be down voted because ""dollar bad crypto good duh"" but hear me out.. 

Let's ignore the fact that in the last 10 years USD inflation has been at all time historic lows and bitcoin inflation has been higher. Let's ignore the fact that one side is over ~80 years and the other is over ~3 years.  Let's ignore the fact that dollar cash isn't even supposed to protect from inflation - treasury bonds, or even a savings account would be a far fairer comparison...

This meme confuses two things: speculative price and inflation. ""Let's put our money into bitcoin so that we can be cast-iron certain it makes an inflation proof 2% a year"" said nobody ever. BTC may be an inflation proof asset - but the market is so volatile you'd never be able to tell. All you're seeing is price speculation volatility. Maybe this will settle down in future but it's not showing any signs.

Besides Bitcoin supply clearly inflates via altcoins. BTC dominance is a measure of bitcoin inflation. Sure there's a quirky seniority thing going on with BTC / ETH at the top and other coins that come and go - but it's basically inflation for crypto.
Isn‚Äôt deflation just gonna widen the wealth gap between rich and poor even more?

It‚Äôs good for a investment but if it‚Äôs the actual global currency of the world. The wealth gap is just gonna widen with each person born into poverty.

23	If Ethereum flips BTC, does it mean BTC will be an altcoin/shitcoin?	1620842223.0	619	"> No, dominance does not matter and is fake metric. BTC holds 100% market share in the category of unusable PoW crippplecoins that intentionally suffer from high fees, slow/unreliable transactions and a completely toxic and brainwashed community with a laser eye cult. It is also the only coin in that category. 1 BTC = 1 BTC.

‚Äî the new max BS coron narrative.
yes.
1 bitcoin will always equal 1 bitcoin.

Or 0.9997 bitcoin after fees.

Unlike doge where 5 doge = 1 doge after fees."

29	Don't be surprised if it comes out in the future that US tax dollars were spent to intentionally disrupt peer to peer electronic cash for the world because it is a threat to the US Dollar.	1621341373.0	572	"When US politicians already declared it a threat to national security, I think I can safely assume that.
That's why we invaded Iraq. They switched to selling oil in Euros in 2000. In 2003 we invaded, and the first thing we did was switch back to the US Dollar for oil sales.

I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but no fucking shit the governement is heavily involved. When you come across an amazing amount of people around reddit saying crazy shit that makes no sense (until you add this motive) it all makes sense again.  

.#1 threat to USD dominance, crypto.  #1 response; divide and conquer via cyber warfare.  I've seen it first hand when my network was attacked for being a big blocker and wanting usable crypto for everyone. That was proof to me I'm on the right path.

The people and institutions most threatened by Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash have turned BTC into gold that's too heavy and expensive to use like cash and which needs a banking layer on top.
I just don‚Äôt understand why BTC doesn‚Äôt want to build upon being a medium of exchange. This SoV bullshit is way too soon, and feels like it‚Äôs killing crypto adoption before it‚Äôs really even started.
It was made illegal for citizens to have gold"
32	Audi or BTC	1614695431.0	565	"LOL, the Audi costs less to move around, ironically.
I mean, are we looking at it as an investment or something I can use.

Bitcoin is unusable as peer to peer cash (it's intended purpose) but it works as an investment. The Audi is an exceptionally bad investment but it's really useful as a car.

Neither have they ever broadcast a transaction. So they don't know how fun it is. They have never felt the power.

63	A friend in Tokyo just took this photo:	1614921517.0	469	"Inb4 BSCoreons claim this is just bought advertising by Roger.

It isnt. This building is the venue of a jewelry and bridal shop/service (Gem Castle Yukizaki). Note how the logo on the building („ÇÜ„Åç„Åñ„Åç) matches the one on the Bitcoin Cash banner. A jewelry/bridal company would not host advertising on its own buildings billboard associating itself in the advertising with what is being advertised. And besides, as bought advertising it would be functionally useless, because it lists no website.

I think it means this company accepts BCH for its wares/services, and they choose to advertise that fact writ large on their building. This is interesting not only by itself, but what that company does would often cost considerable money (thousands of dollars), so it isnt a usecase BTC automatically disqualifies itself for (on account of fees). But for whatever reason (even if you shop for thousands high fees still suck, slow/unreliable confirmation times are still slow/unreliable) they find BCH relevant enough to support it.

Do you see how if Computer B can handle the video market, that it can also handle the book market ?

If BCH's price ever surpasses BTC's - BTC will not just have a lower price - it will cease to be.  At that point there is NOTHING about BTC that would be remotely attractive to any sane user.  the only thing BTC has going for it is large gains, but even this is being challenged by ETH and *even* BCH.  Correct me if I am wrong, but BCH's gains percentage-wise have been on-par with BTC's this bull run.... 10K -> 60K vs... $240 -> $1,200

Wich is only possible because BCH is usable as a currency, cheap and fast, expensive cryptocurrencies like BTC are very tied to fiat currencies, because you can not buy anything with them, they are only useful if you sell for fiat, and on the fiat off-ramp is when banks and governments attacks with taxes, fees, regulation  and censorship.

It's really good news that Tesla will run their own nodes, actually using bitcoin for what it was supposed to do. It's gonna be an interesting experiment.

However I can't help but think that Tesla will be able to use some of their knowledge on market cycles to dump the price when people are buying so they can accumulate more.

""You can't use that name; we stole it fair and square.""
And the store of value part is a lie. Nobody is guaranteeing that someone will buy your BTC from you for an equal or greater amount in the future. Speculation is a ceiling. Real utility is the floor.
Yep, this exactly describes the nature of the split.

Proponents of the Lightning Network argued that BTC should only serve as a *settlement layer* for Lightning's ""payment layer.""  According to them, payments shouldn't happen on the base layer.  In that model, the base layer serves as a value store, the 2nd layer serves as the payment rail.

While it has some architectural appeal the simple fact is that the entire point of Bitcoin was to eliminate the need for the second layer -- ie banks."

- You have BTC maxis telling you that slow confirmations ranging from hours to days to weeks with a clogged mempool are better than BCH's fast confirmations 

- That a complicated Lightning network with 1/10th the original functionality, no offline sending, success based on payment size, requires channel partner cooperation, is better for users than just 0-conf or onchain. Oh and 3rd party watchtower services will watch over your money for a price because it's less secure than onchain.

- That they've created SegWit which technically is a blocksize increase but worse than just and outright one... which uses new made up units called vBytes and ""weights"" ... to distract you from the fact that SegWit takes up the same size on disk as legacy transactions but allows less transactions than a regular blocksize increase would.

- BTC's scaling solution Lightning is 6 years into the ""18 more months"" deadline and it has constant new attack surfaces, liquidity problems and scaling problems. Additionally Lightning fees cost more than BCH onchain fees.

- Blockstream promotes using centralized Liquid instead over Lightning... in /r/bitcoin

- That BTC is not for poor people.

- Onchain fees range anywhere from $5 to $50 AND the Bitcoin developers celebrate and pop ""champaign"" when fees rise and expect fees to get even higher.

- That you shouldn't be spending BTC, you should only hodl because it's digital gold. 

- That all other coins but BTC is a scam.

- That a private company called Blockstream promotes their private solution called Liquid in /r/bitcoin that fixes all of the above problems with Bitcoin.

- And that there is a big overlap with Blockstream employees and contractors with the people working on Bitcoin.

- And since the creation of Blockstream no features were accepted into Bitcoin that didn't originate or were approved by Blockstream.

- One of the Bitcoin Core developers is actively promoting a blocksize decrease to 300KB!

Take away the price and you realize Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme at this point.

You didn't really piss off BTC, bch-monero-ethereum did that. All you did was to make people replace one addiction with another, instead of BTC gambling dogecoin staking, that's it.

Fees? They are worse than BTC

Transaction speed? As bad as BTC

Development? Even worse than BTC

Lies? Equally big as BTC

But at this point it's not really a ""meme coin"" when people stake 10k + thinking it will reach one USD a brain washed induced assumption that has no technical or rational basis.

Likewise with crypto, when one doesn't work to make a payment they switch to one that does. They are not going to try and figure out what is the right fee to make it work and definitely not paying a 15% fee on what they are paying.

So they switch to bch for personal use and leave btc on exchange. That's what's happening regardless of price action.

205	Bitcoin Cash is Satoshi‚Äôs original work	1615292577.0	287	"I can't remember the exact question. It must have been many years ago. If you have to leave a message for humanity to read, 1 million years from now, how would you do it? Obviously, we assume humans are still around because if nobody is alive, then the question is moot.

Most materials erode after a certain period of time. The Earth is constantly changing so what you wrote at one location might be buried into the crust after 1 million years.

It seems the answer is an idea. An idea can survive a million years. An idea can spread and it can grow, and it can live on forever. Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is an idea and that idea lives on as Bitcoin Cash today.

Bitcoin Cash is the people's money and I am one of them.
Satoshi: ""A purely peer-to-peer version of **electronic cash** would allow online **payments** to be sent **directly from one party to another** without going through a financial institution.""

BCH: ""hold my beer""

BTC: ""Bitcoin isn't for payments, it's for 'hodling.'  For payments, route your transaction through a Lightning Node.""
BCH is certainly a lot closer to the original BTC prior to 2015 or so by Satoshi, Gavin, and Mike.

Blockstream took over the code base and radically altered the economic model the original developers and whitepaper writer pioneered. This was done so the Core developers at large could create their own startups like Blockstream (Lightning Labs, Chaincode Labs, Brink, etc) to offer paid middleware sidechains like Liquid to ""solve"" the problem they created. 

I don't think Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, or any of them really ever actually understood what *Bitcoin* was or was supposed to be, since they immediately set out to discredit and destroy Satoshi's version in place of their own. Whether they were paid specifically to do this or was just a total lack of vision combined with troll narcissism is up for debate."

Any way BCH is almost a stable coin now, it does not pump but it also does not dump. I actually like that. I would love to have BCH go up only 30%-50% a year for the next 10 years. Sounds boring but long term this is the way.

Europeans don‚Äôt call Euro an ‚Äúaltcurrency‚Äù.	1609189477.0	282	"This term was coined nearly 10 years ago, a lot has changed since the scaling debates (starting around 2014):

1. Altcoins started as literal bitcoin clones, like Dogecoin, and included ""mild paradigm shifts"" e.g. Namecoin (DNS), Litecoin (more blocks), <insert-crap-clone-here>
2. What started as mild paradigm shifts became major, arguably the first of which being Ethereum (this is debatable and subjective, but it's the truth). Others include Tezos, Ripple, Hashgraph
3. We also got real fights in the community - ""Contentious"" hardforks, particularly Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision, Bitcoin Gold, and a few others, just to name a few
4. Defi then took off, now we have staking protocols, exchange / DEX protocols, and some of it is incredibly easy to use (AAVE, Binance Coin, Uniswap, Kyber, to name a few)

My opinion, and it's just that, is that people who use the term ""altcoin"" are one of three things:

1. Ignorant (new, shallowly-researched, etc.) - have patience
2. Outdated (lazy, but should know better) - these are the ""dabbled BTC in 2013"" types
3. Manipulative - sometimes even maliciously so (aware of other tokens but try to act like they're insignificant in order to flood more money into BTC under the guise of reduced risk). People trying to control the narrative are people I don't fuck with, and generally end up blacklisting from my rhetorical discussions.

FWIW, I think ""altcoin"" is still the perfect term for projects like DOGE. The main thing is that altcoins are generally understood to be high risk / low value projects, and it's clear that Ethereum is actually producing more value than BTC. Eventually I think we'll forget these people because their opinions will be drowned out by trillions of dollars (and 1ETH will still equal 1ETH).

tldr; Inb4 somebody calls BTC an altcoin in the coming years.
I call them all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency.
""Altcoin"" is a deception pushed by BTC maxis which has, unfortunately, a large adoption in the media, because being ill-informed or parroting maxis.

If you now rely on a bank to help you use BTC...what was accomplished ? Even the 21M ceiling is not certain anymore.  A bank can tell 21M customers they have 3 BTC each - and no way to verify that.
Banks aren't used for payments either, payment processors like Visa/Paypal are. The purpose of banks isn't and never has been payments. Nor does Bitcoin compete with bank. It competes with the infrastructure of which banks are a privileged middle man: money.

Payments in the financial context is understood as retail operations, i.e. the payment for goods and services by private individuals to businesses. There are other types of operation that have currency change hands, chief among them, many different types of settlements. Banks don't really bother with the retail part tbh (unless you think your local credit union is what's plaguing mankind).

If Bcash wants to go after payments, that's fine and all. Bitcoin is a settlement layer. There is enormous utility in that. Do not dismiss that and technological constraints that comes with it for the benefits of payments. Payments are subordinate to settlement.

This fixation on payments is narrow at best. Retail is the last served tranche of the financial world. Private individuals exist at the very bottom of the ladder and are utterly neglected by the financial establishment at large. This is in part because that environment is so regulated that no meaningful competition can ever occur, and banks only have to answer to the state, not the customer. It is also because that's not where the money is. 

You can't look at this picture, ignore the regulatory capture, central bank driven inflation, fractional reserve, inexistent interest rates and just straight to payments. Those other problems are bigger and need to be addressed first. Payments will most likely figure themselves out as a consequence.

250	The BCH price will probably rise to match Grayscale BCHG price (~$3500) so that the Grayscale premium falls under 10%, just as ETH did compared to the Grayscale Ethereum trust.	1613507795.0	261	"Not financial advice, just autistic thoughts from a retard that's been following and tracking the Grayscale trends for a awhile. Here are my thoughts:

Since the Grayscale crypto trusts have always been an easier on-ramp into crypto, there's always been a premium over the underlying crypto price. For BTC, this has typically been 10% - 30%, but is finally setting under 10% now that other competing trusts are entering the market. The Grayscale Ethereum trust (ETHE) had peak premium of over 3.5x (+250% over underlying price), on December 23, at which point ETH was $613, yet ETHE closed over $2200, which ETH is now catching up to.

Looking at BCH, for most of the last 30 days, BCHG was 6x BCH, suggesting that those invested in BCHG a over the last month believed the future price of BCH to be well over $2500. In the last few days, we can see the BCHG premium falling, and the BCH price beginning to catch up. As of opening today (2/16), the BCH price was $714, and the BCHG multiplier has already dropped to 4.6x (+360% premium), which implies a market value of $3280. 

TLDR; Not necessarily a good idea to buy BCHG right now, but BCHG interest implies $3k BCH coming in the future.
Without any external effect on the price, the BCH and BCHG prices should meet somewhere in the middle since arbitrage traders buy BCH and sell the trust

251	BCH Searches on Google Trends	1612348498.0	265	"For anyone wondering how I got such specific stats on Google Trends searches, I had to custom set intervals to every 90 days so I could get the daily numbers. Then, I had to save each 90 day interval as a separate file and copy and paste from each spreadsheet to stitch all of the data together. Since each interval is relative to the starting date, I had to adjust the numbers so I could factor it in and get the REAL value relative to the beginning date, giving an accurate representation of the number of searches/queries.

For anyone wondering, this is also a 1 week moving average of the actual data because the actual data itself is very noisy. This compensates for the oscillations, and gives an accurate representation of search interest/count.

Edit: The task was tedious, but I found the results interesting.
Also DuckDuckGo has recently added BCH to their currency tab.

Just showing up to address the issue of Lightning payments not being peer to peer.

Lightning's network topology is, strictly speaking, peer to peer.  However, ""peer to peer"" has a special meaning in this context -- it doesn't refer to the network topology, but refers instead to payments where ""Alice pays Bob with no intermediary"" ie peer pays peer.

When Satoshi used the term ""peer to peer"" in the white paper, he used it to describe the mining network, which is also a peer-to-peer network.  The term has become bastardized to refer to ""Alice pays Bob."""

The market value of BTC is based on tethers 14 Billion imaginary dollars which they used to pump BTC https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/ and margin exchanges like Bitmex. 

The value can collapse and never recover. eg. [recently some miners sold some bitcoins just to pay their electricity bills](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-may-spark-war-of-miners-1-day-pool-outflows-hit-18m) and BTC crashed by $2000  - tether printed an emergency 5 billion tether ""dollars"" in response, imagine if holders actually tried selling their old coins (there are millions of BTC that can be sold at any moment).

Overall the BTC margin scene plus tether printing practices makes Bitcoin's actual value highly questionable and unreliable.

The conflict was started way before Bitcoin Cash was even a thing. You can read about some of the history below.

**1) Why is Bitcoin Cash using the BTC subreddit instead of BCH?**
If you have to ask this question, there is a good chance you are new to Bitcoin. During the blocksize debate, many people including miners were in favor of increasing the blocksize capacity of the network. It was around this time that Blockstream started using...

**1a) censorships** - https://medium.com/@johnblocke/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43

**1b) propaganda** - https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@adambalm/in-2013-peter-todd-was-paid-off-by-a-government-intelligence-agent-to-create-rbf-create-a-propaganda-video-and-cripple-the-btc and  https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/8dd5ij/why_bitcoin_cash_users_reject_the_name_bcash_so/

**1c) threats and harassments** - https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/is1130/it_seems_tim_draper_is_being_misled_about_bch_and/g54x63q/

**1d) DDOS attacks** - http://qntra.net/2015/09/xt-node-blacklists-fail-to-prevent-ddos-attack/

**1e) Plus a bunch of other unethical stuff** if you care to read more at https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/hgpjph/the_pitiful_state_of_bitcoin_cash_transactions/fw5qczk/

Anyone who dares to promote increasing the blocksize or favorably on Bitcoin Cash, they get banned and their voices silenced in the Bitcoin subreddit. They also get harassed and attacked by online paid trolls. Mind you, all these started even before the creation of Bitcoin Cash. That‚Äôs why many of us ended up in this subreddit and are Bitcoin Cash supporters.

&nbsp;

**2) Why Bitcoin Cash uses Bitcoin in the name?**
Both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are forks of the original Bitcoin software and are entitled to the name. While one network forked with Segwit (Bitcoin), the other network forked with a higher blocksize capacity to be peer to peer money for the world (Bitcoin Cash).

&nbsp;

**3) Why can‚Äôt Lightning Network solve Bitcoin‚Äôs problem?**
It has been 6 years since the Lightning Network started and if you had been fooled the last 6 years and still believe that Lightning Network is the answer, then congratulations your 7th year is coming up next. Lightning Network has plenty of problems including losing users funds and requiring users to be online 24/7 and many other problems beyond the scope of this thread. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/k37w3w/ill_just_leave_this_here_sample_page_from_a_paper/ge13qyq/

&nbsp;

**4) Why not use coin XYZ instead of Bitcoin Cash for cheap transactions?**
Bitcoin Cash is accepted by more than 2,651,820 merchants worldwide. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

If coin XYZ is as widely accepted as Bitcoin Cash, then maybe I will consider them. In some places like Australia or Slovenia or Tokyo or Antigua, you can live off Bitcoin Cash entirely without touching your fiat. Like I said, Bitcoin Cash is unstoppable peer to peer money for the world.

&nbsp;

**5) Bitcoin is digital gold and Bitcoin Cash is money?**
Here‚Äôs the thing. Whatever Bitcoin can do, Bitcoin Cash can do better. This means Bitcoin Cash is both better money and better digital gold than Bitcoin can be. The biggest problem is that while Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, Bitcoin Cash had to rebuilt everything from scratch since August 2017. Let me assure you that rebuilding everything from scratch in just 3 years is not an easy task.

The good news is that, first mover advantage alone, as history had shown over and over again, is often not good enough. You can read up the stories of Kodak or Friendster or Nokia. If you missed the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a low price back in 2009, that‚Äôs not your fault. But now that you understood more about cryptocurrencies and you missed out on the opportunity of getting Bitcoin Cash at a low price today, then you cannot blame anyone else.

Bitcoin Cash is unstoppable peer to peer money for the world. Join us in making a positive impact to humanity together.
Lol.  This post is ignoring the reason this community exists.  I was actively participating in r/bitcoin for a long time until they banned me for no reason aside from disagreement about how bitcoin should scale.  

The entire bitcoin subreddit is a disinformation campaign, whereas here there are a ton of trolls, but for the most part, people are genuine.

287	Anti BCH propaganda in /r/cryptocurrency from aged accounts which delete themselves next day	1612444799.0	242	"great sharp observation, thx for sharing
The times they are changing, I guess by now the pool of people that have invested is so big that the 1% from that pool that actually tried using the stuff they invested in, is now large enough that a critical mass of critical users is reached. You know, those weird guys that actually think for themselves once in a while. 

It's going to become harder and harder in the future to portrait BCH as a scam because people that use crypto can't get fooled. 

One of the most bullish things I know is the fact that on [blockchain.poker](https://blockchain.poker/#/?a=ea3d6ad9c73b55454fb8149f74f5041f#cash) there are now ALWAYS people playing at any time and they are primarily playing on BCH tables. 

I am expecting that within 3 - 5 years adoption on Bitcoin Cash will hit a critical mass and go exponential.

So on ETH they are just rebuilding banking  right now, fully automated. People are mainly staking.

There will come a time in the future where these people also want to you know, buy stuff with their wealth and although it will be possible to use ETH for this, BCH will always be better suited for it.

We got 3 - 5 years to just make sure we have very good ETH to BCH bridges and that's it. Boom, adoption turns in to this engine that just fuels itself now and most of our hard work is over.  Then it starts sucking in talent and marketing bois and girls and people with good ideas and some guy figures out how McDonalds can save 20% overhead costs by accepting BCH, etc etc etc. 

Now does that mean that BCH price will go to a million dollars? 

No it does not, but is that really why we are in it? It's nice to be rich but it's nicer to play a part in allowing the entire world to enter a system with more individual freedom at the expensive of more individual responsibility.

That's good tradeoff man! What we need most of all is educators and trainers to train the masses. This stuff is new, hard, complex, and takes an enormous effort to understand.
For any newbies coming here wondering why there is so much anti-BCH propaganda and lies, I would like to spread awareness about this issue,

There are many signs that BTC has been infiltrated. When you put them all together, it starts to form a clearer picture. Here are some examples.

There is consistent trolls/harassments/smear campaigns against Bitcoin Cash the last 5 years. Who is funding all these propaganda campaigns?

In 2013, Peter Todd was paid off by a government intelligence agent to create RBF, create a propaganda video, and cripple the BTC code.

Blockstream kicking Gavin, the lead Bitcoin developer, out of Bitcoin development, successfully hijacked control over the Bitcoin github.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS. Mike Hearn was heavily character assassinated by what I believe to be orchestrated paid campaigns by Blockstream. And of course, now that Mike Hearn is gone, the character assassination campaigns are directed at Bitcoin Cash main supporters like Roger Ver.

There are actually plenty more nasty unethical things BTC people had done which is not covered in this comment. Bitcoin Cash is an attempt to rescue what the bad actors had hijacked successfully, mainly the peer to peer cash revolution. And it won't be the last time the bad actors will try to find ways to sabotage this project.

For as much as all the maxis hate you Roger, you've always remained open and willing to debate and made yourself very accessible. I really glad to see Kim taking a position of offering to rebuild some kind of bridge between maxis and this community even if I am not convinced it will lead to anything.

Even if we all were just a bunch of agitators were are confined to very limited opportunities to advocate for our views because of the rampant censorship and toxic harassment. It should go without saying that no one has a monopoly on what Bitcoin is or could be and no one should be against the open exchange of ideas. 

I lurked on the subreddit for a really long time mostly avoiding addressing the detractors that frequent this place, till I couldn't take it any more and realized while I won't every likely change any of their minds I didn't want to watch them drown out the logic and reason that drives this community and prevent anyone that comes here from learning the history or different points of view commonly shared here. 

I commend you for first jumpstarting the very beginnings of a bitcoin community open to anyone, but for keeping that going through all the personal sacrifices you've made. I recently watched an old video of you talking about Bitcoin to an audience back from probably 2012, nothing about what you say has changed at all and then I look at what many figures who've been around for a while now, but certainly not as long have changed their tunes a number of times now. you'll never likely get the recognition you deserve for what you've done to promote the vision of Bitcoin Satoshi released to the world, but you definitely deserve recognition and I glad to see someone like Kim stand up and giving you credit and offering to a chance to open doors back up."

If you look at those tweets the people saying it's a scam etc. are the same type of people calling Bitcoin Cash a scam today.

Not everyone has the understanding to get in early. That's why so many people in the Bitcoin Core camp got in during the 2017 bull run or are just getting in now and have no clue what they are actually buying or investing in. They just follow the herd. If they read the white paper, understood the tech, took a good long hard look at what the future could be, they wouldn't hate on BCH.

So when we see all these people hating on his current tweet about getting into BCH now - it's like deja vu. Of course people are going to hate on it. They don't understand it, and that's why I'm happy I was a believer bitcoin in 2012 and happy I'm a believer in bitcoin cash in 2021.

and for the record - I don't hate bitcoin. If we want to all call it the new gold, fine. But don't hate on BCH because it is doing what the original bitcoin set out to do.

I don't understand how people think that Bitcoin can be a ""store of value"" if it can't be used in everyday transactions. How can an asset retain its value if its only use is to move numbers around between millionaires and billionaires?

The common criticism of crypto (""its all made up and has no sustainable value"" - see Peter Schiff) is usually countered by saying ""it has value as a medium of exchange that people can use in place of centrally-controlled money."" But what argument can you even stand on once you no longer care about this? Gold works as a store of value because it has secondary uses, it is valuable in some other way. I don't see how a cryptocurrency doesn't fall under the same rules: it only works as a store of value if it is valuable in some other way, namely as a decentralized widely-accepted everyday currency"

EDIT: Just watched someone move over $1,000,000 USD worth of BCH on that site. Transaction fee: less than a penny.
One thing the BTC community don't understand is that they are actually defeating themselves.  The higher the fees on BTC goes, the more of their own money they have spent on fees.  That value came from their labour.  So they are trying to climb uphill to ""store their value"", when the point of Bitcoin was that limited supply meant for once the consumers were back to walking downhill trying to save the value of their labour.

The opposite is of course true for BCH.  Money isn't wasted on fees, so people can save more and also spend more on merchants, aka there is more real economic activity per satoshi spent.

That passive drag adds up massively over time, it even gets worse for BTC if their community ever grows (fighting into an increasing headwind).  That's why BCH is doing so well despite the disadvantage of a smaller network effect and having to rebrand.
Looks cool, what is that site?"

""It will really help get rid of a lot of the capital gains requirements for Bitcoin Cash specifically"""	1620657393.0	231	"The UK decided Btc was considered property. It's not, it's a currency, and they know it. Calling it property is just another form of control. The High street banks in the UK are at least 5 years behind the curve. I literally spoke with my Bank about this very thing like adoption & tax etc. They were ok to talk about it, but admitted that it's only been this year that it has even been on their radar. And that they are years away from integrating it.

So I guess a lot heads being pulled out of the sand this year. To me Btc has become a complex tax issue. Every time you do anything with it, it's a tax implication, besides locking it away and not using it. Bch acts like cash, and feels like cash. I know it still has the same tax implications, but the more adoption happens, and the need to go into Fiat is reduced, then there is no tax.

To me that is the most important thing now, mass adoption. Something that Roger was aware of early on. Personally I became lost on number go up, and can now see the perils of that. I am so glad that Bch has survived long enough for people - like myself - to wake up and see what it is. 

It's the real deal, it's Bitcoin.
A country, any country, adopting Bitcoin Cash as its official currency would be absolutely staggering as a milestone.

A lot of countries use fiat currencies that are issued by other, more powerful countries (either by using them directly or by using currencies that are pegged to them (like the Eastern Caribbean dollar that Antigua uses, which is pegged to the US Dollar)). So the financial health of these small countries are tied inexorably to the monetary policy whims of the corrupt and/or incompetent politicians in the US, Europe, and China.

Even though the US dollar is garbage, countries use it because all the other fiats are even worse. If a country were to successfully transition to bitcoin cash, it would show the other small countries of the world that they don't have to put up with that chaos anymore.

What's more, the first countries to make the swap and switch their reserves over will come out way ahead in purchasing power since demand for bitcoin cash will go crazy as more countries start switching to it.

Unfortunately, I assume the US/Europe/China will use military force and/or economic sanctions to prevent this for as long as possible. The next several decades are going to be extremely interesting.

If BTC continues to not address the levels of onboarding friction it's creating, I think that not only will ETH supplant BTC as the top coin, but other alts will also gain substantial ground on it as well.

However, if that trend continues, BCH will also likely eventually catch back up and become BTC...

It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see what the world learns from how this plays out in El Salvador.  

I really wish El Salvador had chosen any crypto other than the ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù store of value coin, that you‚Äôre not supposed to spend.  

Do you happen to know if the connection an end user establishes using the app is even a lightning network channel?  I‚Äôm suspicious that it‚Äôs not because of the difficulty LN channels bring when it comes to maintaining your inbound and outbound payment capacity.
It is currently only available in US and El Salvador. This is because of jurisdiction. Strike has to have a node in every country that is necessary for being a payment provider

He's cheaping out on his fees and/or price during a volatile downward spike, causing his order to not get filled. He does this 3 times in a row, learning nothing. He also expects all nodes to process his transactions and compute the various stateful success/fail conditions, for free.

That's all gone now with Bitcoin.

But thankfully that all lives on with Bitcoin cash!
As someone who has a small interest in either.  I can see the value of BCH.  I was on the faucets for a few a few months several years ago.  Just recently looked at my Freewallet out of curiosity and saw my DOGE, LTC and ETH had swelled up from less than $10 to about $75.

I converted it all to BTC.  I thought cool, I'm going to move it to one of the Crypto banks and let it continue to sit, but gain interest.

Sadly I'm learning it will cost me about $38 of that $75 just to move it out of my wallet to a Crypto bank.  These BTC fees are crazy.  I should have researched a little before converting everything to BTC.
Making this pinned for a day or 2 wouldn't hurt.

Congratulations! Logic is slowly winning people over. Either that or the ludicrously high fees on Bitcoin is becoming impossible to ignore for regular users so they reasses Bitcoin Cash.

I also noticed a bigger trend with the disinformation campaign pushed by Blockstream and Adam Back and I was wondering if it's just me or have others noticed this too.

- in 2017 /r/cryptocurrency, /r/bitcoinmarkets all heavily referred to Bitcoin Cash as ""Bcash"". Any threads submitted were Bcash this, Bcash that. In 2020 and after, it seems 99% of submissions refer to Bitcoin Cash as BCH, instead of Adam Back's term even in /r/bitcoinmarkets and /r/cryptocurrency. I also see this with resident trolls here like /u/mishax1 who only used to call it Bcash and now not only does he say BCH but even the content he submits in /r/cryptocurrency refers to [Bitcoin Cash as ""BCH"" and not ""bcash""](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n4len6/trust_wallet_just_removed_autochange_address_for/)

- The ONLY places I see Bcash still being used is /r/bitcoin as they have automod filter BCH and the mods literally request you only call it ""bcash"" explicitly to brainwash users. https://www.reveddit.com/v/Bitcoin/comments/ml5kgw/bch_is_bitcoin/gtjze8g/#t1_gtjze8g

- The only users who call BCH, Bcash are Blockstream founders like Adam Back and Greg Maxwell.

- Blockstream funded exchange Bitfinex used to list Bitcoin Cash as ""Bcash"" until they lost enough traders due to name confusion and now they list Bitcoin Cash as BCH/Bitcoin Cash. All other exchanges using the term Bcash also stopped playing these games and just use the official name."

This.
If it's no longer competing for payments why do people always try pushing LN for payments?

BCH does compare itself to BTC, the old BTC before the fees became unbearable.

Pretty sure stable coins defeat the whole point of crypto..

I think the main problem, when you try arguing for BCH to people who only like BTC, they think you are saying ""It's a better coin, the price will go higher than BTC"", that's all they hear.

They just think ""BTC is a better stock"" which might be true, they don't really care about crypto for payments. This is the impression I get anyway, most have never even used crypto to pay for anything, so in reality they don't even understand what they are missing or why it's needed.
Is anyone else just exhausted from this ""what is the real Bitcoin"" debate? Let's just get on with our lives; realize that BTC and BCH have different value propositions, and move forward.

It is the ""distributed timestamp server"" - aka the mining network which gathers transactions and timestamps them into blocks - which is ""peer-to-peer.""

trump was an absolute conman, and he even managed to con the libertarians and such that projected noble things onto him.

edit: downvoted by gullible ""libertarians"".   observation: when external government and law enforcement are weakened, ethics and personal integrity become even more essential to a free society. trump was an example of someone with zero integrity therefore should be shunned. if you gave him any support or respect, you got played and also betrayed your own convictions as an ""anarchist"" or ""libertarian""."
382	Bitcoin Cash is accepted at far more physical locations than any other crypto currency. https://map.bitcoin.com/	1625388695.0	212	"As much as I love this map, it's only as useful as the effort being put into its content curation.

100% of the pins on this map that are within 100 miles of me fall into one of these 3 categories:

1) ""Menufy"" locations, which means they use Menufy to process online-only payments, and one of the payment options that service offers is to accept BCH and immediately convert it into dollars. So the business doesn't accept BCH, they may not even have heard of it; they just happen to be using a middle-man that will accept BCH (and other cryptos) on their behalf.

2) Businesses that have never heard of BCH. There's only one pin in this category -  there's a restaurant about a 2-hour drive from me that's not listed as Menufy, and I seriously considered making a half-day out of driving there just for the experience of paying in native bitcoin cash. I called ahead to verify and they had never heard of it.

3) Addresses of apparently random residential houses in run-down neighborhoods. I don't know what goods or services they're offering at these locations in exchange for BCH but I'm not interested.

&#x200B;

I think [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) needs to consider two changes:

1) a toggle switch to hide locations that are not using BCH but are using an online-only 3rd-party to accept crypto and convert it into dollars. I can't speak for anybody else but I'm not interested in supporting this model (which just replaces one middle-man with a different one).

2) a job assignment for somebody on-staff to make sure every location has been contacted recently (maybe within the last quarter) to verify that they really are accepting native BCH payments in-person. maybe another toggle switch to show/hide ""unverified"" locations
The key word here being ""crypto CURRENCY"" 

Remember what satoshi felt was so important that he included it as a permanent reminder in that first block ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""
A bail out by the public of the rich. Why did they need bailing out ? Because the banks had been chasing easy money trading financial products. Satoshi gave the world bitcoin to stop that kind of shit. A peer to peer electronic cash for the people. Crypto currency.
What's happened since ? Blockstream turned bitcoin into digital gold so the same kind of high risk trader that had caused the crisis that led to the bailout, could now trade crypto while normal people could no longer use it as currency. They flipped it upside down.

Maybe the reason satoshi is no longer around is because he saw the absolute shitshow his dream was turning into, that the new fair money he had created was just going to end up being used in the same way those bailed out bankers used fiat, tether anyone ?
It's a cool map but incorrect in spots and when you report places that are incorrect they don't do anything. It has literally been some of the worst customer support I've ever had I've emailed them back and forth now for almost 6 months that a location is incorrect and they realize this and only a Bitcoin ATM not a place that accepts Bitcoin cash and Alexander from bitcoin.com keep saying it'll be fixed since the beginning of this year but they have not done a single thing and frankly I'm kind of pissed off at them
        
Who knows how many other listings are fake that they won't correct just to boast numbers
            
I love Bitcoin cash but I hate the Bitcoin.com Maps team cuz they don't do shit.
         
A couple months ago I posted my string of emails with them because some of the people didn't believe me and they were shocked when they saw my emails with bitcoin.com map support.
           
Alexander and the Maps admins need to do their job.
         
 idk if MemoryDealers can do anything about it but they are really making his company look bad. Alexander has the emails about the reported location. He told me it would be fixed 4 months ago then started asking me to do his job by properly identifying the location for him instead of HIM calling or emailing them months after he did nothing
         
Sorry that this has been so negative but I'm just fed up and tired of the map showing locations ""that accept Bitcoin cash"" but that *actually* don't or are just bitcoin ATMs unmarked"

When Bitcoin ABC devs tried to cash in, the BCH community opposed it and the community succeeded.

When Blockstream tried to cash in by making BTC a settlement layer, they somehow convinced people that it was okay which is the difference between the two.
yeah and gold was also never meant to be an investment piece but a metal with useful properties. Yet it seems to be doing quite fine for about 5.000 years with no end in sight.

As a crypto enthusiast I am interested in what other cryptos will do to cash. As an investor I think that BTC is not measured by its usefulness, but by its social proof as investment piece.

BTC won't remain market leader forever. BCH has a high chance of becoming a top crypto if we keep working at best CASH. We also have other cryptos like ETH working on more complex problems of smart contracts, which is another realm.

All of us old-school early adopters sought out bitcoin to avoid centralization.

408	Bitcoin Cash was not the result of a failed takeover attempt. It was the result of a successful takeover attempt.	1612972241.0	201	"Bitcoin as a store of value is not a threat to anyone with power. Bitcoin as a medium of exchange very much is. If regular people stop using fiat monopoly money in favor of a currency that cannot be controlled, those powerful people lose the ability to transfer wealth from all fiat-holders in the world to themselves by generating more of it out of thin air.

When it became clear that Bitcoin was technologically impregnable, the attacks against it shifted towards controlling the code and controlling the narrative. I participated in a small way in the fight against the takeover attempt, and it was rough. The attackers were incredibly well-funded, extremely coordinated, and totally relentless. Aggressive censorship, mass disinformation campaigns, character assassinations, trips to Asia to tell lies to miners, an endless army of trolls and the useful idiots who joined their ranks, non-stop FUD including technological-sounding gibberish meant to sow confusion, constant stalling tactics, and on-and-on-and-on-and-on.

Make no mistake ‚Äì this was a battle and the good guys lost. Given the enormous, nigh incalculable, potential of a decentralized peer-to-peer currency to improve the condition of mankind, I view the takeover of Bitcoin by its enemies to be easily one of the worst things that has happened in the world in the past 50 years. The tragedy of the whole thing is that the world doesn‚Äôt even realize the amazing opportunity it lost.

The fight continues today; the people who captured Bitcoin to prevent it from becoming useful now attack Bitcoin Cash because it is the next biggest threat. There have been two failed hostile takeover attempts of BCH in the past 3 years. The censorship and lies continue in earnest on the largest cryptocurrency forums. All the same tactics they used against us from 2014-2017, they‚Äôre still using against us today. The important difference is that now that they control the name ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù, they can pretend that it was theirs all along and that the people trying to preserve Bitcoin‚Äôs original goal were actually the ones trying to derail it. After all, ‚Äúthose who control the present control the past, and those who control the past control the future.‚Äù

If Bitcoin Cash ever fails, they will simply switch their attention to the next largest cryptocurrency project trying to be decentralized currency, since that will represent the next largest threat to their total control of money. Global-scale peer-to-peer electronic cash cannot be allowed to exist and they will do whatever it takes to stop it.

413	It is already time to implement fractional satoshis per byte if we want to be money for the world.	1621680861.0	196	"Please understand that fractional satoshis/byte are already here!

It is the wallets and nodes that don't forward them to miners, (to prevent spam attacks on the p2p portion of the network). 

You can change the behavior of the nodes bitcoin.com runs *today* if you would want to!
Even though i think you're correct, it's not something that is needed very soon.

Right now the issue is that most mining and non-mining nodes only relay transactions with a fee of 1sat/byte (as it's the default in most node software). If you want to see the fees go down YOU can already change the setting in the node software for the bitcoin.com nodes used for the bitcoin.com wallet and the bitcoin.com mining pools. You can go as low as 1sat per transaction, which would be cheap enough for almost any purpose even if the price rises significantly. Even though it won't be mined by everyone, you can still be sure your transaction goes through as long as the bitcoin.com mining pool mines a block regularly (you can even make it a setting in the bitcoin.com wallet). Be the change you want to be. Maybe you'll even convince other mining pools and node operators if they think about it the same way. Node devs will change defaults when there is enough demand for even cheaper transactions, but you don't have to rely on them for these kind of non-consensual changes.

""Satoshi per byte"" is a presentation for humans, nodes and wallets already deal with ""satoshis per kilobyte""."

u/Remarkable-Culture39 , you need to hear the other side of the story.

In 2017 the Bitcoin blockchain and currency split into BTC and BCH, and BTC ended up crippled.

BTC is the version that made permanent the 1mb block size limit, and so it has congestion, high fees, and is unreliable. It's not cash anymore, Steam stopped accepting it, tipping died, etc. That's why in uncensored forums like this one, BTC isn't considered Bitcoin anymore. [Full story](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/lr8ekl/who_not_bitcoin_cash/gom8izo/)

BCH is the version that stayed true to Satoshi's 2008 [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf), and therefore it can actually be used as cash directly (no need for bullshit like LN). Transactions are instant and cost under a cent, even after surpassing BTC in [daily transactions](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-bch.html#6m).

There are many signs that BTC had been taken over by bad actors already. When you put them all together, it starts to form a clearer picture. Here are some examples.

There is consistent trolls/harassments/smear campaigns against Bitcoin Cash the last 5 years. Who is funding all these propaganda campaigns?

In 2013, Peter Todd was paid off by a government intelligence agent to create RBF, create a propaganda video, and cripple the BTC code.

Blockstream kicking Gavin, the lead Bitcoin developer, out of Bitcoin development, successfully hijacked control over the Bitcoin github.

Mike Hearn and Gavin wanted to prevent Bitcoin from being hijacked, so they created a fork. That fork didn't survived after they were heavily DDOS. Mike Hearn was heavily character assassinated by what I believe to be orchestrated paid campaigns by Blockstream. And of course, now that Mike Hearn is gone, the character assassination campaigns are directed at Bitcoin Cash main supporters like Roger Ver.

I was involved in some BCH projects and there had been multiple DDOS attacks and other stuff, such as flooding my inbox with few hundred thousand emails per day. I'm sure those activities are not for profit, so why are they doing it?

There are actually plenty more nasty unethical things BTC people had done which is not covered in this comment.

It was very naive to think such a ground-breaking technology as crypto would not be fully regulated and taken over by world government(s).

Back in 2018 I made a small purchase with crypto, and the merchant said to me, ""these payments are so cool, it's impossible that this goes on like this forever, they (the state) will create taxes and destroy this beauty eventually."""

Compared to < $0.03 for a BCH transaction, a coin which is much more powerful, scalable and widely accepted.

451	Bitcoin's divisibility is limited by how high its fees are. You can't split BTC further than the fee. Try sending 0.0001 BTC if the fee is 0.0001 BTC and see how much (0 BTC) arrives at the destination. The LIMITS the number of people who can use BTC.	1614345340.0	189	"No shit sherlock
Main reason why I never got BTC when I was a student and didn't have much to spend. The current fees on BTC probably excludes more than 90% of the world from being able to use it.
Not only does it limit the number of people, it blacks out any unspent transaction below the fee amount. So even if you have more btc than the fee, you still might not be able to spend it if your balance is comprised of many small inputs."

456	Bitcoin Cash is irrationaly undervalued.	1612470488.0	189	"What is the valuation method used for the projected ""fair value""?
I don't believe that BCH is undervalued. I believe BTC is overvalued and so is most stuff in the top 200 because Tether leverages everything up by pumping in money that does not exist.

The only exception is ETH, I think ETH is currently valued at exactly what it should be at this stage.

If everything pumps but BCH, long term this works in our favor.

We will attract the ""Let's build, let's use, let's have fun"" crowd and not the ""Let's get rich without working"" crowd.

I believe BCH will end the year around 1000 USD but if it's 500 USD I will be happy as well.

I like BCH to become less volatile and be known as the coin you can't use for pump and dump.
Probably lots of naked shorting involved to keep BCH down. 

If BCH started mooning, then the dumb money buying Bitcoin-Core, based on the name alone and ""number go up"", would virtually disappear. Tether would be left holding their BTC-Backed USDT tokens which would be worthless and maybe 10% backed at that point."

460	Honest question and I hope you don't ban me for asking, but why are people still keen on BCH?	1613489886.0	186	"We're not /r/bitcoin. You don't get banned in this sub for having an opinion, being informative, weighing your options, or mentioning other cryptocurrencies. Not saying the sub is perfect, but it's definitely not run by a team of sycophants.

At least that has been my experience.
Uff a lot of answers here. But let me give my take.

Bitcoin Cash Community came from Bitcoin. A lot of us, myself included, got interested in Bitcoin for the economic freedom that it has the potential to provide. (This should also answer why r/btc is mostly BCH, a lot of the users here are banned from r/Bitcoin for asking the ""wrong"" questions, this was pre bch being created which is why it's called r/btc, as it was and is an uncensored alternative to r/Bitcoin) 

I say potential because we are not there.

But put simply, Bitcoin wanted to be electronic cash. It says so in the white paper feel free to check it out.

[Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

Somewhere along the line a majority of the community changed to the current narrative of store of value. (don't want to get into the politics of it. but you can try posting a negative sentiment about bitcoin on r/Bitcoin and see where it gets you). 

Anyway, Bitcoin Cash came from the part of the Bitcoin Community that still wanted electronic cash. 

A currency that is used and valued by the world is also a good store of value. A store of value with no use other than the ability to sell to the next person is...

I'll let you take your own conclusions there. As that is my opinion and many outside this subreddit seem to disagree) 

As for why Bitcoin Cash? Just like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash has a lot of network effect behind it. That in part, is the reason. On top of that the technology is tried and tested since 2009. But no one is saying Bitcoin Cash can't lose the race. But you can be sure that this community is working hard for that to not happen. 

As for the fees. Bitcoin Cash has no upper limit on the number of transactions that can go into a block. No limit means that transactions aren't fighting to get into the block. They all get included. So where do miners get their money from? Adoption, usage. 

More usage, more transactions, more transactions more tiny fees. 1 transaction with a $1 fee or 100 transactions with a $0.01 pays the miner the same. So no, the fees won't go up with usage. 

As for the fees of $0.01 in India. It's all about incentives. If there are enough users submitting lower fee transactions, a miner will lower their minimum fee until it is economically feasible for them to do so, if they don't someone else will and they will lose out on those fees. It is also in the miners incentives that these users be heard and their transactions included, as this will lead to more usage and adoption. More transactions, more fees also more value for the network which also ends up resulting in a higher coin price. 

So while we haven't heard of anyone in developing countries complaining about the current 0.001$ it is totally possible that they will and miners will respond according to those incentives. Which is why we must work on adoption. 

Hope this clarifies. If you still have questions feel free to ask away or even disagree with my statements. Will be more than happy to clarify further.
Welcome :)  This sub is not censored you will not get banned here for asking questions. It is basically an uncensored r/bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash works! Simple as that. It is the continuation of Bitcoin before BTC crippled it with a blocksize limit to tiny 4 transactions per second. All other coins I looked at are either premined, have some kind of master node or are otherwise centralized.


>. Also, not sure if this is correct but once more people use BCH won't the fees just rise?

Nope BCHs goal is to accomodate all transactions therefore there is always enough space for everyone and fees will be set by what miners are willing to mine and not auctioned away to the most expensive (in fees) 2500 transactions.


Nano is not free, you pay with a tiny bit of POW which you have to pay for. Also the concept is interesting, I think Bitcoins model is much more solid."
461	Libertarians built a Bitcoin economy in a small New Hampshire town ‚Äî then feds tore it down	1627927742.0	184	"That's a good article. I think it's pretty well balanced, though it doesn't really get into any of the technicalities involved. It is frustrating that the government likes to treat Bitcoin Cash like money in order to make it easier to charge people with money laundering-related violations while treating it like property for tax purposes and in order to make it unrealistically complicated to use it for everyday transactions while maintaining compliance with IRS rules.
This is just another datapoint for why the developed world is not suitable for the next steps in crypto mass adoption. The nation-states are too strong there.

Who could honestly believe that Satoshi, who disappeared entirely in 2011, invented one of the most libertarian things ever, one of the richest people on planet earth and who published his own work freely online at the very beginning, is going to spectacularly return from anonymity just to sue them over hosting the Bitcoin whitepaper?

Also as a note to OP: low interest rate could indicate low borrowing rates. When more people want to borrow (to short), interest rates go up. If interest is the lowest, BCH might be the least shorted, because smart money know it'll eat shit soon when it goes up.

My homepage, says I've blocked 83k trackers and ads, 1.2gb of data, and it's saved me over an hour in load times.
Some of the biz tactics of bitcoin.com have rubbed me the wrong way in the past.    
But I have to say I find this move very welcome and well aligned for adoption of BCH.    
Kudos to the folks at bitcoin.com for pairing up with brave.     
I find brave effectively marketing their value and expect it‚Äôll continue to gain in popularity. Also, a big chunk of the value proposition of brave overlaps with BCH.
This news raises my enthusiasm about BCH and definitely moves me to investigate a new avenue to acquire BCH.

Some of the **Key points made:** ‚¨áÔ∏è

**""Strike controls all private keys, and users NEVER have access to keys unless funds are withdrawn.""**

""Risks/issues of Strike:-Requires some level of KYC-Not permissionless or censorship resistant (there are NO guarantees against balance restrictions/seizure/service disruptions)-Running on their own centralized network.

The LN is only used internally, user communication is done exclusively via Stike‚Äôs servers. A disruption of EITHER the LN or Strike‚Äôs serverswould cause temporary or potentially permanent access to funds.

The LN is fundamentally a P2P permissionless protocol, but it has serious drawbacks that, when combined with a bottlenecked L1, is not suitable for mass adoption.

I have seen bursts of network activity like this before, usually when noise.cash gets a bit behind on their tipping and needs to catch up.

But undoubtedly they aren't the only app or service that is seeing constant growth in adoption on BCH, and each service snowballs on each other in terms of network traffic. Particularly if they coincide in terms of a sudden peak in global activity.

I have never seen a sustained burst of transactions as long as this though, it wasn't a 5 or 10 second thing it went on for more than 2 minutes probably.  And usually the surge follows on from a period where transactions dip off a bit, but this time it went from already a pretty healthy throughput to a huge surge and followed with healthy 5 or 6 tps afterwards.

Predictably, the network didn't have a single issue with it, as it was doing more than 9x the BTC throughput.

Despite all of the hate that it gets, I see Bitcoin Cash as an excellent project. I'm an engineer and tech educator by trade (not that you should take my word for it on ""authority""). Things I love about BCH:

* Sensible engineering plan in the roadmap (support for scaling via things like CTOR, Schnorr, Graphene, etc.) 

- BCH avoids overly complex solutions like Lightning that are both technically brittle and have a bad UX

* Passionate community of developers building different things on top of it - merchant tools, tokenization, etc.
* Community has the values that got me excited about Bitcoin in the first place (peer to peer cash for the world) rather than ""muh price, institutional money incoming""

What did you learn about that changed your mind?
Most of us here were BTC maximalists for years before the Blockstream drama happened. Reason being, there *were* a lot of shitcoins like Litecoin dick-riding on Bitcoin, and we wanted to build the Bitcoin Satoshi envisioned.  Slowly, as Blockstream took over, Greg Maxwell refused to increased the blocksize limit, and BTC Maxies started bullying everyone into the Blockstream echo chamber, we started to break away from BTC.  So there's no reason to feel bad for buying into their BS, it takes time to debunk all of it.

OP, what made you change your mind about BCH?

542	I'm finally in for BCH.	1612487524.0	166	"You‚Äôve made the right choice in terms of utility and freedom. That said bch is fighting a very tough disinformation battle. Don‚Äôt invest what you can‚Äôt afford to lose.
I've been here from the old days. Honestly, I have had my doubts whether the project would succeed, despite the clearly correct moral and technical position

But now, I'm more hopeful than ever, because:

* A clear public funding model has appeared
* Successful alternative social media and communications
* Unique projects that aren't running on other blockchains
* Rising transaction value
* Successfully maintained top-10 status for years

Though I am still concerned about the relatively low share of miners. It seems like the chain is vulnerable if like 1 major BTC miner decided to fuck with it - causing double spends, fucking up 0conf, spam, etc

However, I don't think BCH is going to flip BTC or ETH anytime soon. This is an opinion only. Thus, the upside of holding BCH is relatively low to me. I feel that it will maintain rank and move with the larger crypto ecosystem. Not much downside to holding it either, though ‚Äî it's extremely resilient, and so is the community

Someone told me recently that they were liking the phoenix wallet because it's non-custodial.

I looked into it and it looks expensive.

* On-the-fly channel creation: 1% of the amount received, with a 3000 sat minimum fee. This covers the cost of opening a channel. The amount received must be at least 10 000 sat.

* Swap-in (on-chain tx to Phoenix): 1% of the amount received, with a 3000 sat minimum fee. This covers the cost of opening a channel. The amount received must be at least 10 000 sat.

* Swap-out (sending from Phoenix to a bitcoin address): variable, depending on the bitcoin mempool usage and our current UTXO set. Note that we're not taking a cut here, everything goes to the miners.

So to open a channel with ¬£1,000 that's a 1% fee, ¬£10. With BCH's ¬£0.001 tx fee that means you could send 10,000 transactions for ¬£10. And if you attempted to send the same number of transactions on LN you'd have to hope that you can route all 10,000 transactions via the same node otherwise there is another fee to change channels.

BTC is meant to have a high fee. Here is a few things the BTC devs have said.

Hey /uWiseAsshole, thanks for this post and thank you to anyone who has donated so far!

I tried to upgrade the VPS yesterday to one with double the spec and tested that and that didn't resolve the issue. I suspect it may have something to do with something clogging up the list of utxos that my server is giving me. It might be the dust that is sometimes sent to an address after funds are sent there.

My current plan is to write a script to go through all outstanding tips and send any stuck funds to the tippers/tippees. Then run the bot again and see if the problem resolves itself.

If that doesn't work and I can't figure out the issue with the node, then I might revert to using a 3rd party service although I'd like not to rely on one if possible.

No amount of price volatility is particularly surprising to me, as long as perception/belief is the predominant metric for valuation. Sudden moves like this would be impossible once the value is intertwined with tangible goods and services that are more difficult to move than opinions. 

Your opinion has no physical presence and it can change on a dime. When the dollar (for example) changes its value, it also means a change in how we valuate all the incredible mass of things it can buy. That gigantic pile of goods and services is a lot less likely to change rapidly than everyone‚Äôs airy fairy beliefs and perceptions, especially those of speculators.

Checked in on /r/Bitcoin for the first time in a while, and this was front page.

Bitcoin was designed to remove intermediary parties, but with fees as they are it is not possible for all users to transact on chain.  Bitcoiners therefore trying to reconcile increasing reliance on custodial solutions with the anti-custodial ethos, to limited success.

It appears complexity and lack of education is being blamed for this issue (so maybe they are not even aware it is actually fees), so they are giving up on even expecting new users to learn how cryptocurrencies actually work and guiding them through to the other side.

I particularly enjoyed [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m3k6wz/if_bitcoin_is_going_to_be_mainstream_we_need_to/gqphh8z/) which really shows the paradox (emphasis mine):

> A big part of why Bitcoin exists is to solve the problem of trust between untrustworthy parties. And just in case it's not clear to you, ""untrustworthy parties"" very much includes banks, exchanges, ETFs, and crap like BlockFi.

> **The fundamental problem here is that they force you to trust them. And that means they can run off with ""your"" money.** They can enforce arbitrary laws, like KYC, and stop you from using ""your"" money in ways they don't like. To the degree that they keep their vaults private, they can even lie about whether ""your"" money even exists. They can engage in shady practices like Fractional Reserve Banking or Quantitative Easing.

> They can do this because it's not ""your"" money. It's their money.

> That is literally the bullshit Bitcoin was invented to fix. **It simply makes no sense to wrap Bitcoin in an untrustworthy second layer. That defeats the entire purpose.**

They know the problem perfectly well, but their solution (Lightning Network) is the exact same thing.  It just hasn't dawned on them yet.

Keep your Bitcoin Cash by all means, but also buy it to spend it at vendors who accept BCH.

When stores realise they will have a competitive advantage if they accept BCH they will join in also.  That way the ecosystem will grow.  We need to differentiate ourselves from BTC.
Yup the btc corp holders are dumping bch just enough consistently to keep the price down while driving the herd of sheep towards btc. To be honest I think it's worse than that. 

I'll probably get downvoted like hell for it but I believe when Bitcoin Legacy reached the scaling crossroads, I think the large stakeholders and influencers realized that there was potential to make money multiple times from the same ip. We have Btc segwit, Bch, Bsv, and now Btabc. This wasn't an accident. Don't for a second be convinced about the villainous cartoon characters being the root of the splits.

The Bch road map was the simple choice but not the most profitable. It also wasn't a guarantee that it would run smoothly in the middle of an adoption surge. There could be bugs left to iron out that could be detrimental. So you take out an insurance policy and get all the actors to enforce the narrative so that your free to experiment with each rendition each solution, profit on all and ride the finally chosen one to the moon. 

The whales own it all. It doesn't matter which one wins or loses to them as long as they can use the psychological tactics to maximize their profits and increase their positions as much as they can they will.

Even if the lower bound estimate of LN activity too low by an order of magnitude and BCHs transmittance is too high by an order of magnitude, it is still laughable.

LN as a solution to payments that cannot happen on BTC due to high fees is an abject failure.

The problem wasn't that people couldn't trust fiat to pay for coffee, the problem was that fiat is the worst possible storage of wealth. Theoretically, BCH could do both but people keep pouring into BTC, not BCH. BTC is the psychological category winner of the crypto space with ETH has a close second.

All the cash ability of BCH is a nice additional bonus but not something that the people who are the main price drivers of the crypto-market (institutions, insurances, governments, companies, banks, etc) are interested in. BTC already does what they wanted and the fees are laughable compared to the amount of money they control and laughable compared to what they used to pay in the past to move money from A to B.

I get that BCH can do more that BTC, but that is not enough to win. BCH is losing the psychological battle while BTC gets free advertising from every news outlet on the planet.

Microsofts Zune player was technically better in every aspect compared to the iPod. Didn't matter, the iPod was already the category winner. There were plenty of social media options that were better than Facebook... you know how the story goes.
The good old coffee meme. I stopped using BTC after it fucked me with fees to transact properly. It's either waiting or paying a premium. And everyone claiming LN is the solution, should show a simple solution that 1. works (everytime!!!) and 2. can be used by a non tech savy person. Install App and go.

And exactly this is what i can do with BCH right now. It should not come as a surprise that people right now are paying with BCH and working with BCH for example in venezuela. Let's see some real world  implementations. Let's give LN something like 18months more to achieve this."

I know a guy who was very close to the cryptographer's group where Bitcoin was launched. My friends and I observed a pattern about him and others like him that when you are far removed from being able to do what Satoshi did, you have nothing but respect for Satoshi. But when you are super close to being able to be Satoshi, you have nothing but disdain for yourself for not doing what he did.

So for the past 7-8 years, all he does is criticize Bitcoin for all sorts of issues (I mean this guy knew about bitcoin before it was launched).

This is the same kind of thing you gotta see about people like Adam Back. The man who was super close to inventing Bitcoin, since he didn't do it and the history will only know the name of Satoshi (if the things remain the way they are) then he would be very much interested in 'fixing' bitcoin in a way it doesn't need so that he can 'akshually' Bitcoin.

 For the same unit of energy input, BCH processes 1000x more txs.
There is no fee market for BCH so it's better than the block size difference.

First 'they' (whoever they may be) were downvoting pro-BCH talk immediately below zero in huge bunches, which was very obviously manipulated, and then after a certain point they switched strategies to downvoting most of the comments toward 1, to make it look like the threads were hardly trafficked instead. This helped disguise the manipulation. Sometime after the fork it seems to have largely stopped, but it may have started up again. I don't know.

Not sure if you have seen this but this interview Roger gives a history on how he started his memory dealers business and why he ended up accepting Bitcoin pretty early on: https://youtu.be/8NeKP_jCGyU

It's long but it's worth bookmarking and listening to in small chunks if needed, they cover a lot of Crypto main talking points

It's similar in many ways to the now famous clubhouse stream with KimDOTcom, where they start getting into why crypto exists and what it should try to solve.

You can hear Pomp struggle with combating with some of the ideas of bigger blocks and keeping a crypto focused on being a currency first but he remains civil during the stream, so you get to hear two very different views try to hash it out.

[Fees won't matter as long as you're not actually using it. Will/do people use Amazon stocks to buy or sell goods and services? No. So even if BTC is failing at being a medium of exchange, it won't matter as long as the price is going up by enough to incentivize people to buy more with the expectation of high returns. **Fees of BTC will continue to go up, while yearly return on investment will continue to go towards 0 as more liquidity is built up for BTC, and more money is required to push the price upwards. Eventually, an equilibrium of where there are high fees and almost next to no returns per year (failing to even outperform stocks) will be achieved.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/k6suuy/btc_has_a_strange_network_effect_problem_the_more/gen0ujf/)

[**At this point, it won't make sense to hold BTC anymore, and the illusion of ""store of value"" as a function of speculation will no longer work as a narrative.** BTC has chosen not to scale on-chain, which will end up having long-term consequences even if they're not obvious right now. Bitcoin Cash has chosen the ability to scale, but that doesn't guarantee it success either if or when BTC fails. BCH will succeed if on-chain scaling proves to be successful, and BCH sticks to its roots (as it does today) of being the ""minimum viable fork"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/k6suuy/btc_has_a_strange_network_effect_problem_the_more/gen0ujf/)

Once Bitcoin price reaches a price equilibrium there will be no more reason to buy Bitcoin. As users realize Bitcoin is too expensive to transact with the bubble will pop as there is no purpose to hold Bitcoin anymore and the Store of Value narrative will fall apart. After all something is only a store of value if people believe it's a store of value."
653	A peculiar observation about Bitcoin Cash and Roger Ver	1605119116.0	150	"I've never met Roger, but here's what I've seen of him during my years hanging around Bitcoin.

Roger has always been extremely consistent in his messaging: the power of Bitcoin is its use case as cash - a way for people to transact person to person with no financial middlemen, without the possibility of financial censorship, by using a token that is simultaneously a hard asset and a currency for casual transactions.  In short, if you have to put it in a bank to use it - even if you call the bank a ""hub"" and your account a ""channel"" - it's no longer disruptive or empowering. And especially, if you have to exit crypto for fiat in order to purchase something, then it's disrupted *nothing.*

Roger's message, you will realize, is also Satoshi's message.

Roger, like Satoshi, understands that to truly be disruptive, cryptocurrency has to be a means of exchange in its *native, bare-metal form.* And he's been on message for about a decade now.

Roger has also demonstrated his ethos here and elsewhere by sponsoring this uncensored Bitcoin forum when all other platforms became curated / censored by special interests. Since the creation of rbtc I've seen any number of toxic trolls post all manner of hateful and dishonest crap targeting Roger, and he allows it to stay up because he walks his talk.

Roger is a human being and has his flaws and bad moments like all of us. Like most of us he can get hot tempered or occasionally say something inadvisable.  But overwhelmingly he has been a principled spokesperson for Bitcoin as Cash since long before the block size debate was even a thing.

I disagree with Roger sometimes regarding his politics, which I often find naive - but these are unimportant quibbles in the grand scheme. The bigger picture is that Roger never silences disagreement with him. And for that he has earned a tremendous amount of respect from people who interact with him over time.

There's an old adage that we often repeat around here: ""you know you're over the target when you start picking up flak."" Roger has been picking up flak for the better part of ten years now. I'm honestly amazed he sticks with it sometimes.

Thank you all for the kind comments.  Peer to peer cash for the world!
In a way it's sort of like stabbing someone in the back once there's nothing to lose from it. When Bitcoin Cash came out, it got a lot of hate before Roger Ver even got involved. Everyone dismissed it, and didn't bother paying attention. He was one of the few who decided to actually take a look into it, and supported it after doing his own research. His vocal support of it goes back to August of 2017, and he gave a great speech that explains why Bitcoin Cash is good money.

The weirdest part is ABC hating one of the few people who actually supported them, AND put his personal principles above wealth. There were plenty of people who could've made Bitcoin Cash be worth much more than Bitcoin today by being vocal about their support, but only cared about short-term interests."

664	Bitcoin Cash is likely the most decentralized cryptocurrency. There are 6 development teams innovating on the scaling front.	1616640690.0	150	"I think people underestimate just how incredibly important this is.

Centralization means the ability for a single entity or small group thereof to have undue influence on the network in a way that gives them advantage at the cost of the rest of the network.

While a single node implementation *can possibly* be set up in a way that enough developers have a say towards what is committed that there is little developer advantage or risk of centralization, This system also requires users pay close attention to how many and what types of people are allowed to contribute and if certain development ideas are being completely shut out.

This is a sign of possible centralization.

Having multiple node implementations that work together (Like on BCH) vastly reduces this undue influence because a potential adversarial commit must be reviewed by and pushed through 6 independently operating node teams.

This means the commit button is much more difficult to centralize.

I sincerely hope we continue to see even wider node diversity as time moves on.

Even now, there is no other coin I'm aware of that has this level of diversity in mining nodes.

Dealing with this as a merchant is so much trouble and annoyance. It makes me want to stop taking BTC but it's hard to say no to money when so many wants to pay with it.

My solution has been to charge the fee from the customer that I will have to pay to spend it. Then effectively the customer pays double fee, one for sending the TX and one for the TX that we will make to spend it. BitPay does it in the same way and calls it network fee. It is the only way to not lose money depending on your margins and especially for the low amounts that effectively gets burned by the miner fee otherwise.

I do all I can to recommend people who have issues with fees and slow confirmation of BTC, to use BCH instead.
You can't be minimising the BTC transaction fees; they have to increase.

BTC is intended to have high fees. The devs want it to increase.

FACTS: BTC has been turned into a speculative gambling token. Only the rich will be able to acquire it and USE it. LN is a failure after 5 years of development and hype. BTC doesn't have any new privacy tools but also old privacy tools are unusable anymore because of high fees.... COME ON, IT'S NOT HARD TO CONNECT THE DOTS.
Edward Snowden should check out Bitcoin Cash.
It may not be popular here, but Bitcoin identified a single use case that does not require scaling. Bitcoin is basically a store of value. You don't have to have a lot of transactions for that. You don't have to have adoption for that. You just need people/institutions/funds willing to buy and hold.

Expensive transactions are just fine if you only pay them when you deposit fairly large amounts of money into bitcoin. They're fine if you are buying a house. They're fine if you're making a rare distribution of funds. And if you're willing to use custodial solutions, cheap transactions are possible. They're just not done on the blockchain.

Was this the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto? No. I don't really see it as the Bitcoin of the Bitcoin White paper.

But as a reserve currency, as a store of value, as a investment for retirement, for many purposes, Bitcoin works.

Unlike ethereum, Bitcoin doesn't have to succeed in some sort of radical, massive technical effort to continue as a store of value. It really doesn't have to do anything.

This is a powerful use case.

It wasn't the one I argued for in 2014, it's not the one that is helped in any way by a lightning Network. But it is a needed and useful use case.

Bitcoin as a store value is going to give the cryptocurrency space the shelter to grow and actually achieve the Bitcoin White paper. As a protocol, what we know of is bitcoin, will never be what we dreamed of in 2013. And I'm okay with that.

Or at least I've come to be okay with that."

People are more likely to spend their money if there is inflation. Without inflation, the incentive to hoard money is much higher. And if more money is being hoarded than spent, then it's not working well as a currency.

2. Deflation causes inequality. If the value of what you own always increases, it means that those who accumulated wealth first will always remain more wealthy than who start later. On a cursory note, one might say that's only fair. But if so, new people are less likely to join the system.

I also have to dispute the idea that adoption is already growing. People have been posting a lot of charts recently showing how massively use of BCH is skyrocketing. But as I‚Äôve pointed out in several of those threads, the only metrics showing that are the ones that are very cheap to manipulate.

ABC don't want to compromise and Amaury doesn't even care about BCH. He has dollar signs in his eyes and he is aiming to grab as much money as he can from BCH or Bitcoin Amaury Vision chain. If both of those attempts fail, he'll get a 9-5 job... I'm personally sick and tired of this toxic guy.
No. ABC shouldn't stop. The only way is if they make an announcement that they quit altogether and recommend to run a different node like BCHN. Because if ABC would cancel the IFP now, they will probably still be the lead implementation coming November. This would mean the whole ABC powerplay will continue for another 6 months. The infighting will continue for another 6 months. It will be another 6 months without any improvement to the protocol. It's better to split and get rid of them, than to keep them in charge of the protocol any longer, hurting the coin for a longer period of time. 

Now it's time to publicly speak out against this kind of behaviour. Make sure the entire ecosystem follows the non-ifp chain and vote with your wallet and hashpower. If 1 man can dictate what a cryptocurrency is and cause so much damage to a decentralized currency, than these currencies aren't as resilient or decentralized as people made them sound.

Then again, if you're looking at BitcoinCash and think it's underlying value is as a speculative asset, you're probably in the wrong place.

BCH hasn't been a very good store of value, nor accumulator of value. It has been, however, a fantastic tool to transfer value - and it top of it's class when it comes being battletested and mature with regards to its optimizations and scaling.
People shitting on BCH are the people invested in BTC. If BCH proves that onchain scaling works, BTC could become obsolete, so those people are just trying to protect their investment.

Your logic is flawed. Fractional reserve banking allow banks to loan money they do not have which virtually increases the supply of money. The lightning network doesn't allow people to send bitcoin they do not have, every bitcoin is backed 1:1. In practice it does the opposite of fractional reserve banking because it shrinks the available supply of bitcoin. People will open channels just to make it easier to route transactions and this will lock their bitcoins while the channel is open.

Will Venmo support peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trades?
Not at this time. Venmo only supports the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency using your Venmo account. To complete P2P transactions with Venmo, all crypto assets held with Venmo must be sold and thus converted into USD.

So this is why forks happen here on BCH, it is the original Bitcoin that is still freedom-loving, open-minded and not centrally controlled. While all other Bitcoin forks are not in one or more of those 3 categories.

As per why only Bitcoin Cash is insulted daily since 3+ years, it is because it is the only coin that poses a threat to BTC. BTC is held by many and many lead figures in Segwitcoin rile up their minions by way of example by insulting Bitcoin Cash and its followers in public. Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin and DeFi shiz doesn‚Äôt pose a threat to BTC because it is not better.

El Salvador can‚Äôt adopt BTC as a non-custodial peer-to-peer currency because the transaction capacity is too low and fees too high.

El Salvador can‚Äôt adopt BCH either simply because it‚Äôs too small and already much more volatile in price than BTC. Every BCH ever mined is currently valued at 9 billion USD (ignoring that a significant proportion are lost). El Salvador has 6 million people. So that‚Äôs $15 per person. This means that country-scale adoption would create the biggest BCH price bubble the world has ever seen. 

Countries don‚Äôt want a currency that will massively change value overnight, and importantly most/all governments don‚Äôt actually want non-custodial peer-to-peer digital currency. 

BCH will have to grow (a lot) organically through community adoption, like the whole North Queensland thing before any government even considers making it an official currency.
BTC always gave Ethereum shit, labeling its token and all its layer 2 as shitcoins. Now LN comes along and its paraded for mass adoption. Bottom line, layer 1 should scale, people are confused enough in this space. Not working with the main chain as intended is delusional.

759	Amaury‚Äôs IFP is Incompatible with Bitcoin Cash	1598471217.0	137	"Good read!


>Fast forward to late 2019.  I attended a Bitcoin Cash celebration in Vancouver and sat next to Amaury on the connecting flight.  It was at that time when he explained to me how the total SHA-256 pool would be forced to subsidize BCH.  I thought it was a clever idea, and important to help ABC get the infrastructure funding they needed. In 2020, I took it upon myself to try to help ABC in this way.  I contacted BTC.top, ViaBTC, and Antpool and presented our idea.


Is this the first time you disclose this? I've never heard it before and was sure that the miners came up with the IFP.

>ABC‚Äôs version of the IFP (if you can even call it that) is so poor that the issues are surfacing even before it is released.  Take myself for example -- in the span of half a year, I went from being someone who Amaury wanted on his 2 of 3 multisig to a political enemy.  The project I maintain (Electron Cash) went from being ‚Äúessential infrastructure‚Äù that was included in the first IFP to a project now demonized by an ABC supporter. The only discernible reason for this change of position is that I am now an IFP opponent rather than a suporter.  This is what happens when politics are invited into the protocol.

üëç
I like the article, but I'm a little concerned that this is preaching to the choir. 

What we need to be doing right now is convincing exchanges, as they are the ones who have the ability to assign the ticker symbol (and therefore the coin identity of ""Bitcoin Cash"", in the eyes of the general public).

Your article lists exchanges as part of ""the community"", but I don't think that's the case generally. There certainly have been a few who also run miners and have commented by making statements about what they will mine, but there are also many that have not commented at all, including major ones like Coinbase, and others that have taken (dubiously) ""neutral"" positions. Many, despite listing BCH, may not consider themselves part of BCH's ""community"", and may not be interested in its politics.

I think those exchanges aren't looking for these kinds of arguments. It's a little too ""Here is why ABC's plan is bad"" and not enough ""The BCH community rejects ABC and its plan, and here is why you should listen to the community"". 

Many coins just simply have centralized development -- lead devs that implement whatever ideas they like, whether they make for ""sound money"" or not. Exchanges deal with these kinds of coins all the time. I don't think the exchanges particularly care whether these changes are bad for a coin. They just let the devs do what they want with ""their"" coin and leave it to the market to decide which coins are valuable. 

I think what we need is a short article that makes a compelling case to these exchanges for **why Bitcoin Cash should not be treated that way -- why it is important that Bitcoin Cash is not defined by a single dev team (ABC) or a single website (bitcoincash.org).** I fully expect that if we can get *at least* ""fair"" ticker treatment, BCH can reject IFP successfully -- almost no one wants the IFP. My last remaining concern at this point is whether or not the disinterested exchanges will give the non-ABC chain that treatment, and that's why I believe we need to be focusing in this direction.

For instance (just one idea) -- we could argue that Bitcoin Cash came about in 2017 because the rules of BTC could not be changed to accommodate a significant hard fork block size increase, and the BCH community has always seen Bitcoin Core's resistance to such a change as a large reason for this. That's why, ever since the earliest days of BCH, BCH has prioritized having multiple implementations, **specifically** to avoid a recurrence of that situation where one dev team gets the final say on consensus matters, and that is why there are six or so BCH node implementations available and why the majority of miners have already switched to a different one. The BCH community may have gone along with ABC in the past based on the merits of the individual decisions, but it was never the case that the community saw ABC as some kind of definer of the coin who gets the final say on **all** decisions, and therefore, to treat BCH as being owned and led by ABC (or defined by bitcoincash.org, which ABC controls) despite massive opposition from the ecosystem would go against the central principles of the coin's community.

(Maybe there are other, better arguments.)

Also, we need to clearly and concisely back up any claim of massive opposition to ABC. We could probably do that with a signed statement by everyone against ABC's Coinbase Rule, and more generally, against BCH being defined by the decisions of a single entity like ABC or Bitcoincash.org. We have a statement by those in favor of ASERT over Grasberg, but that is technically outdated now. We also have lots of individual statements, but nothing really nicely presented that unites them, I think. 

I think we should have a new statement, or at least an easy-to-parse table of all the major figures in the BCH ecosystem and who stands on which side, [like this one that was made for Segwit](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support), so that the exchanges can clearly see at a glance where the ecosystem support is. We shouldn't expect them to be keeping up with all of our drama.

Sorry if this comment is a bit of an oblique response to your article.

2nd: A lot of people here, myself included, have warned about keeping funds on exchanges. As this will give exchanges all kinds of ways to use userfunds for their own benefit. E.g. this allows them to sell fake crypto on the Exchanges, which will kind of inflate the supply of crypto and thus influence the price. I keep nothing on Exchanges, as i rather be the actual owner of my crypto.
That fraud is called ""fractional reserve"" and it's very plausible that exchanges engage in it for profit

The point is really simple for bad actors. Don't start a fight if you don't want to receive the punches.
I don't understand why there is a ""for/against"" debate with regards to these attacks.

It simply *is* happening.

As you stated, we strive for permisionless chains. Either we want permissioned, or permissionless chains, we have to chose.

If you are against, you are for permissioned chain, end of story.

Does it mean I am for, absolutely not. I simply do not care. If a chain is not viable, is not worth enough to be defended, then it deserves such fate.
I think the voluntarism.dev actions on BAB chain could be counterproductive at the end of the day. Focusing on taking someone else down is always a net negative. It loses you people who are only interested in building and it can call to the defense of your target defenders it previously did not have. That said, these empty blocks and reorgs are not aggression any more than the IFP was.

But I still can't understand why Amaury has not implemented replay protection. That is unconscionable. What a tremendous mess he has made and at the end of the day, for what? To illustrate the importance of a small cadre of fanatics getting paid... getting paid for what? Team ABC presided over a massive decline in interest and price in Bitcoin Cash. And now they are responsible for only making things worse. Absolutely disgusting.

Let's all try to refocus on building a future for Bitcoin Cash that is inclusive of and attractive to the whole world. We should strive to leave behind old grudges and stop trying to settle old scores. 99% of the world has yet to hear about bitcoin. If we get our acts in gear, they can hear about Bitcoin Cash first and start using it right away to solve problems and build new wealth.

I get the need to protect the value that is within Bitcoin Cash. I am down with that 100%. That said, for every action there is an inevitable reaction and it is best not to overdo it. If someone wants to kill BAB chain, please make it a swift kill.

And let's try not to give any further oxygen to BAB chain. The real currency of the crypto ecosystem is drama, and these empty blocks are minor drama right now. I wouldn't want to see it turn into major drama and BCH get a rep for anything other than building world-scale P2P electronic cash."

791	WTF: Bitcoin Unlimited looking forward to build yet-another-blockchain: nextchain.cash	1622456126.0	136	"For BTC developers, there's [Groestlcoin](https://www.groestlcoin.org/). Does the Groestlcoin economy have any significance? Does it really provide more value to BTC developers than a testnet? Previously, Litecoin activated SegWit before BTC, did that actually yield any helpful feedback or funding to BTC developers? Or are they just small competitors?

Let's consider a feature like OP_CHECKDATASIG, which originated from BU and was deployed to BCH mainnet in November 2018. To date, as far as I know, the only user of this feature with significant economic weight is Local.Bitcoin.com. Now imagine you instead deployed this to a separate blockchain that has a 10√ó-100√ó smaller economy. Do you really expect to get this real-world economy feedback and/or capital investments you're looking for? Furthermore, the final design deployed on BCH has technical differences from the original proposal from BU (for better or worse), so you'd end up with technical debt having to maintain two variants of the same thing.

There's basically two possible scenarios. The most likely scenario is that the new chain will not have any significant economy, and hence it fails to meet the stated objectives. The other, unlikely scenario is that there is a significant economy leading to fragmentation of network effect and a large conflict of interest for BU. Both outcomes are bad.

BU is free to do as it pleases, but I would recommend to BU members to give up the idea of having a testnet with a real economy - it's not going to happen - and instead set up testnets with experimental features and provide good infrastructure for those testsnets (nodes, explorers, wallets, other services, etc.).

As an aside, it can be useful to brainstorm about what BCH should look like if you would start it from scratch today, as it can offer guidance for how BCH's protocol should evolve over time. In particular I would love to see CHIPs for UTXO commitments and 2-minute blocks.
Anyone can tell if they read the thread, but gotta repeat: I'm a BU member and I strongly disapprove.
WTF indeed.

The story of Bitcoin Cash is a story of a fractured community:

1. The fork with BTC
2. The fork with BSV
3. The fork with ABC

And now, BU wants to create a completely new cryptocurrency, and thinks it will be ""good for BCH""? Nah, it will just fracture the community even more, which is the  *last* thing that BCH needs.

While I'm interested in the technical features, I'll echo the moral hazard of funding a new crypto using BCH development funding.

And to be honest, it sounds like sour grapes from Andrew that the BCH community didn't jump on his token proposal, therefore he's saying ""fuck it, I'll create my own coin, and I'll use BU funding to do it"". You're welcome to prove me wrong."
792	It is time for Coinbase to give out a crypto that someone could actually withdraw $5 worth of. BCH seems like the obvious choice.	1620762469.0	136	"That's the whole point. You get $5 you can't do anything with because the transaction cost is higher than $5. It hooks you in.
Coinbase should allow you to convert that to another coin anyways. That's what I did. Convert to BCH and send
The cynic in me says it makes good sense for them to continue using BTC for their rewards and referrals program. Since Coinbase is custodial it doesn't cost them anything to put $5 worth of imaginary Bitcoin in your wallet. If you want to transform it into real BTC by sending it out of the Coinbase ecosystem, you have to buy more BTC from Coinbase and pay their fee. It wouldn't take long for those fees to exceed the value of the BTC they gave you.

However, since it's currently a standardness rule, in order to avoid a case where diverging relay rules could inadvertently make it easier to double-spend, it would be good if there was a coordinated rollout.

I am under the impression that such a rollout will be happening for the May 15 upgrade date, and I know that all related node softwares are either ready, or actively working to get ready, for such a rollout.

In theory it could happen earlier, but since there is already an expectation of node owners to update software for the May 15 upgrade point, it seems reasonable to coordinate it for that point in time.

Do you believe there is a much more urgent need and that this is something that cannot wait until May?

Edit: Some people might've interpreted what I've said as offensive / blaming, so I changed the tone to be less assertive.
I don‚Äôt have that much more to say on this other than removing the unconfirmed transaction limit would allow flexUSD to scale vastly more than it does today.

Bitcoin is not completely immune to this (while is has high fees). One of the most dangerous attack vectors on crypto is legalized mining: a deal if a form of national pools for miners to be public corporations, to officially employ, have pensions and social benefits, pay taxes, expand wherever, mine whatever, but blacklist any tx if required. If G20 will do this, shuffling hardware around the world will become a pain first and unprofitable much sooner. There's a chance that miners will comply and transparent ledgers will lose censorship-resistance however immutable they are. It's even easier to force LN hubs/PoS masternodes to comply to all of this, cos their have to have public IPs and almost undeniably a financial operators from a legal angle

The fact that existing in legal fields of all the jurisdictions energy companies have strong incentives to get into mining business increases the risks of legalized mining attack on crypto

Thank u so much u/MobTwo & many other smart and productive Bitcoin Cash lovers 

We truly made a difference, saving BCH from a coup & realizing dream of P2P Cash that Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to be
Definitely deserves a big thanks. He was able to see something undervalued and hurting due to ABC's actions, chose to invest in the ecosystem, and I think he will make big money from that play. Bitcoin Cash has now proven itself to not only be the most decentralized currency in the ENTIRE WORLD, it is also the best money, and this is obvious to anyone who uses it. 

The support from Marc among others who have put really large amounts of $ on the line betting on Bitcoin Cash has been a giant motivating factor for me too, I think for many people. There is so much upside potential with Bitcoin Cash. Not only in terms of USD valuation, but in terms of changing the world. As governments continue to print trillions of dollars under the guise of ""stimulus"", robbing the poor of their purchasing power and redistributing their wealth to the already wealthy, Bitcoin Cash is available for those who want to preserve their wealth and use a currency that cannot be debased by the snakes and criminals in the central banking slave system.

I think over the last year a lot of peoples eyes have been opened to the extreme market manipulation and overall fake economy powered by infinite money printing. The loss of civil liberties, censorship, etc. are all branches from this root and control over the money supply. Bitcoin Cash is the solution to all of these problems. We will build a new economy based on sound money, worldwide and unstoppable, and people whether they make $2 dollars a day or $20000  will be better off for using it. Free and eventually fully independent from the failing fraudulent fiat system.
So he is perfectly set to be our next villain *nervous chuckle*

* We were a venture backed company. This means they expect to see millions of users in a very short period of time. If you can't show that they lose interest very quickly. Unfortunately, this can cause you to make decisions to allocate resources in ways you wouldn't otherwise have made.
* Cryptocurrency isn't really being used for commerce. It's niche has become an investment asset similar to gold. And like gold, nobody uses it as a medium of exchange. There are no successful cryptocurrency-only retailers. And the ones that do accept cryptocurrency for payments do very little volume in cryptocurrency. This really limits the reach of any cryptocurrency-only marketplace like OpenBazaar. With that said, I think OB could effectively serve a much smaller user base. Something on the order of thousands of tens of thousands of users. Just millions like VCs want to see is unrealistic at this point. And will probably still be unrealistic 10 years from now.
* There's a big conundrum in that what OpenBazaar does best is enable people to sell stuff they aren't allowed to sell elsewhere. But that essentially means illegal stuff. For people who don't have a jail wish you're left trying to get people to buy and sell stuff on OB that they can buy and sell anywhere else. There isn't much of a value proposition there. It's easy to say ""Find some niche items that are legal but people aren't allowed to sell on Amazon or eBay"", but that's much easier said than done.
* A desktop application is a severe barrier to entry. People want either a web app or mobile app. Mobile apps, like Haven, are basically a non-starter. Apple heavily censors what they allow on the device and would never allow OB. This is a very inconsistent policy actually as they allow web browsers which you can use to visit any page on the web and do not require browser developers to censor web pages they don't like. OpenBazaar is basically just a browser for the OpenBazaar network. In fact, it's literally a modified chromium browser. But Apple requires hardcore censorship of the app to the point where you basically can only show whitelisted vendors else an Apple employee see something someone posted for sale that they don't like and pull it from the app store (which happened to Haven).
* A classic web app is both centralized and exposing the developers to legal risk for what people sell. It might be possible to build a decentralized web version, however. js-ipfs runs entirely in the browser so you can theoretically build a purely javascript version of OpenBazaar and serve it up from a web URL and let the browser interpret and run everything. There are still serious challenges with this, however. 1) It would take several very high paid javascript developers a year or longer to build such an app. It would be a huge effort. 2) You probably still need a hosted database somewhere as OpenBazaar nodes generate data that needs to be stored somewhere less ephemeral than in a browser. So some third party would need to provide that service 3). I think due to complications with webcrypto you can't make direct connections to desktop nodes over websockets. So direct connections would require some kind of centralized relay. 4) The legality of serving a p2p javascript application from a URL that you own, and with which users then do whatever they want, has never been explored. Who knows what liability that would open you up to.
* OpenBazaar as an app never got to where we wanted it to be. It had a lot of bugs that we could never stomp out because we were always busy with other stuff. It also needed a better browsing experience, curated content, and a store directory, among other things to improve the UX and keep the app fresh.

I've written a new OpenBazaar codebase is much faster, easier to maintain, and (hopefully) much less buggy, and has a lot of those missing features, but we never got a chance to deploy it. Maybe it will happen at some point if there is enough interest.
My perception is that they lost interest in the project.

He's right about BTC. Too bad nobody has explained him the takeover of Bitcoin.
BTC is nothing like gold. In poor countries, poor people accumulate physical gold $100 at a time and self custody, as a store of value. They could even accumulate it $1 at a time if they wanted.

Whereas poor people (99% of the world population) cannot accumulate BTC $100 at a time and self custody, the fees are too high.

They also have no access to safe custodial services, (not that it would actually compare to self custody physical gold in any way whatsoever).

custodial services are NOT stores of value. As #1 retard micheal saylor loves to say, ""gold was confiscated 100 times in history!"". Guess what, your custodial services are gonna be confiscated too.

BTC is provably not a store of value. It is NOT like physical gold. It CANNOT be accumulated in self custody $100 at a time.

It‚Äôs already been suggested to him and he acknowledged it on Twitter but all he said was ‚Äúfair point‚Äù. 

Fuck Elon.
There's something very familiar about all this. Elon saying ""Hey it would be cool if this worked at scale"" and being bombarded with responses filled with lies about the limitations of blockchain technology (basically saying ""its not possible for it to work at scale"") is the same vibe as the BTC/BCH conflict.

One interesting difference is that Elon has a much louder megaphone than any 2015-2017 big-blocker did. During the Bitcoin takeover, blockstream et al. could just delete posts and ban users that were spreading truth, but now one of the richest people in the world is saying things that don't fit their false narrative (like that there is a gigantic real-world need for fast, high volume, low-fee transactions), and they can't do anything to shut him up. 

It seems to me that there are two possibilities:

1) good guy elon - recognizes the need for global-scale decentralized payment network, backed bitcoin based on its (false) reputation and name-brand recognition, was genuinely surprised to find out it doesn't work, genuinely doesn't realize there are projects that already check all his boxes, genuinely believes crypto is another industry (like electric cars and commercial spaceflight) that needs an innovator like him to move it forward, and picked dogecoin because hey if he has to pick up a project and fix it himself to get the payment network the world needs, he might as well use one with a funny name. once he does a little more homework, he'll see all he needs to do is back the right horse(s) and everything will work out

2) villain elon - is fully aware of bitcoin cash and the progress its made and is fully aware of other projects pursuing viable global-scale money, but is not interested in any of those because he doesn't and can't wield control over them

&#x200B;

Maybe it's just me trying to see the best in people, but I think possibility #1 is more likely.
- Shorter block times make a POW crypto less energy efficient because higher orphan rate (more wasted hashing)
- Doge hasnt done the scaling work to sustain 100x tx rate (uxto processing optimizations, block propagation, unconfirmed tx chain length, general bottleneck optimizations, parallel processing), but BCH has done a lot of that (and continues to, it is the mission statement of BCH: on chain scaling)
- BCH has 0.1 cent fees

So yeah... Elon wants Doge to be BCH. There is an easier way..."

[12 Reasons Why Bitcoin Cash Is The Real Bitcoin](https://news.bitcoin.com/12-reasons-bitcoin-cash-real-bitcoin/)
This point of view is inextricably entwined with the identity and competitive advantage of BCH and therefore it is not possible for it to be abandoned. 

We will continue our work to ensure BCH is widely recognized as the crypto project most faithful to the Bitcoin whitepaper.

Trying to stop us is pointless and a waste of time.
Bitcoin BCH is the Bitcoin that works like Bitcoin did from 2009-2017: with low onchain fees so you could use it like cash, and blocks that get bigger as the economy grows. 

It is Bitcoin BTC that changed Bitcoin's secret formula to stop the blocks from getting bigger and discourage its use as cash.

I bought most of my Bitcoins in 2012 and BCH is the version of Bitcoin that I thought I was getting -- specifically, cashlike use case and hard forking to a larger blocksize (which was the way that us early adopters were promised Bitcoin would upgrade).

If what I just said bothers you, then I'm sorry, but it's not a negotiable truth.  We can agree that the general public considers BTC to be ""Bitcoin"" but as you said, definitions can change when people decide the word means something different, so they can also change back.  As you point out, most of the people buying Bitcoins are so clueless and naive that they might not even know ""which Bitcoin"" they want.  Therefore it's ridiculous to consider the issue settled when so many people still understand so little about what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin."

This is becoming the archetypical cryptocurrency senescence narrative:

1. Start a cryptocoin. Make it cheap and easy.

2. Set distant software limits, but not too distant, to discourage 'spam'.

3. Try to capitalise on popularity by developing second-wave technologies that are so overconfidently complex in design that they'll be delayed for years, bringing multiple fresh rounds of funding for the developers.

4. Notice that the bloated new designs are not shaping up to be as popular as the lean machine we started with. How do we fix this?

5. Whoa, here come those software limits we set on the original design, what should we do, should we raise them, or let them ride, forcing everyone to adopt our less popular solution whether they want to or not? What does everyone think?

6. Ha ha, just kidding on figuring out how to raise those limits. *Obviously* we will just do the forcing thing. But thanks for your opinions!
Afaik raising gas limit again could increase orphan rate too much. In the past they weren't shy about raising it but 13 sec blocktime is just not a suitable design choice for a substantial increase.
Vitalik has been wringing his hands on twitter for years about the need to keep fees low and all their efforts to do it, at times shitting on BTC for letting fees escalate how it has, even quoting his own run-in with high fee events on ETH and how serious they take it...

And yet here we are, years later, ETH2 still not rolled out (let alone sharding, that'll come much, much later). So somehow, despite all his best efforts, and trough at least 2 ETH high fee episodes, and 2 bull markets, ETH has still not gotten its shit together, or is anywhere close to.

And now ETH maxis take to twitter that devs/users aren't gonna abandon ETH because... reasons.

Vitalik wanted to create BTC2, and he has in fact succeeded to do so, in all regards."

>Bitcoins utility in payments makes it more attractive to hodl.

Bitcoin's 200% annual growth makes it attractive to hodl. 

Many, many investors (inc myself) do not see BTC as a currency, now or in the future. We already have currencies, we don't need more currencies. What we need is a non-inflatable, non-corruptible store of value, which can be accessed almost instantly, anywhere in the world by anyone with an Internet connection. 

What we definitely don't need is some greedy, greasy banker debasing our currency by drastically inflating the money supply and sapping the value from the currency. Just look at inflation on your assets - how much did a car cost in 1970? Or a house, vs now?

It is, by far, the strongest asset to hedge against inflation in the world atm. When that changes, so will my portfolio.

And THAT is what attracts hodlers

It's absurd on its face, I can't understand how we've got to the place where some, even when small minority, consider redirecting a part of the mining reward towards a specific single entity even remotely acceptable.

It was always a part of social contract of Bitcoin that miner rewards would not change, do it even once and it's not Bitcoin anymore, even worse, it's a slippery slope - if mining rewards can be changed/redirected, what else? Change issuance, change the 21M coin limit? These are the cornerstone of Bitcoin and it's bizarre anyone would condone fiddling with them.

If you think Bitcoin was set up wrong, well great, go make your own coin and do it differently, more power to you but leave Bitcoin as originally specified by Satoshi out of it or you'll justifiably be called a malicious bad actor attacking p2p cash for the world. Just as Core has and as Amoury is doing, unless he announces his own coin with separate name and ticker.
If it isn't how you feel you are letting personalities get in the way of principles.
Yep. As I‚Äôve said before:

This is an obvious attempt at a 51% attack.

If I acquired 51%+ of the hash rate and began orphaning all BCH blocks other than my own so that I collected all mining revenue, that would be an obvious 51% attack. If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't ""give"" me some minimum fraction (e.g., 8%) of the coinbase reward, that would also be an obvious 51% attack. If I began orphaning all blocks that didn't give *my friend* some minimum fraction of the coinbase reward, that too would be an obvious 51% attack. And, as far as I'm concerned, that remains true even if ""my friend"" is a developer who promises to use those funds solely to fund the development of better Bitcoin Cash client software.

You guys absolutely love to take small sections of a large piece of text and pretend like it means something else. Yes, Strike recently added support for stablecoins including USDT. No Strike users do not have to use Tether. Users can just buy and send bitcoin using The Lightning Network.

The article says ""An El Salvador user can simply go to a Bitcoin ATM or local Bitcoin teller and receive their local fiat currency. El Salvador user requests to sell $100 worth of Bitcoin from Bitcoin ATM. El Salvador user scans the Bitcoin ATM QR code with their Strike app. Strike debits their Tether balance and converts it to bitcoin using its real-time automated risk management and trading infrastructure. Strike then sends the bitcoin to the desired Bitcoin ATM address. The ATM receives the bitcoin and issues the user their local fiat currency. Remember, your Strike balance is spendable wherever bitcoin is accepted! It‚Äôs your mobile bank account interoperable with the Bitcoin network. What if an El Salvador user wants to get access to bitcoin the asset and doesn‚Äôt want USDT? Buying bitcoin with Strike is easy and free."" This is also just one small section of the long article.

Another section says ""We believe the true exchange rate between two individual fiat currencies are the net of a BUY and a SELL between them and Bitcoin. Strike maintains a live Forex rate and compares that to its own rate before every transaction. However, in our testing, a Strike international transfer has never been done at an unfavorable exchange rate when compared to Forex rates. Shockingly (or maybe not) it was even cheaper sometimes, exposing the flaws and lag in Forex rates and how they are used. Bitcoin, as the most liquid, globally transferable asset is already acting as the new world reserve currency with Strike.""

Strike is based on Bitcoin and it utilizes Bitcoin's second layer payment protocol called The Lightning Network.

Why all those hoops, Strike? Can't you just take USD from account that's sending and credit USDT to the account that's receiving?

I'm not that long into the crypto world as you are, but started a year ago and for me there are 2 projects with my full focus. Not for trading, but for investing because I see a future for it.


BCH, as real P2P money, with mass adoption around the corner mostly because the low transaction fees and it is for the unfamiliar with crypto people the first name they do know. Bitcoin. $60k, is too high to step in for many people, specially if you are used to have several numbers of stock, and also because of that I think newer people will buy BCH before BTC, so can have sooner 1 BCH.


Cardano is another project what I'm following and I know it's far from 100% live, but the time line and the steps already achieved does give me a good feeling about the future which align with my personal vision of what crypto can do for the world. I know this is a BCH sub, so I don't want to post too much about Cardano here, but I think both can be the top projects/coins when it comes to day to day use."

When /r/btc was trending for a day Greg got so irate he made a big post slandering both Roger and BCH effectively blowing up and painting Roger's conviction as part of BCH's problem. It's the tired out tactic of ""If Roger bad then ergo BCH bad"". Roger is a big supporter of BCH for sure, but not it's creator. It's the same Blockstream tactic of making a mountain of a molehill and painting selling firecrackers on ebay before there were any rules prohibiting it is the same as selling C4 on the blackmarket to ISIS... and that's why BCH is bad kids. It's all they ""got"" on BCH and it shows. Now they can throw around words like felon and convicted.

His other tactic is bringing up past faults of Roger like involvement with CSW including spamming this sub with the group picture on a boat... while hiding the fact that Greg Maxwell offered his assistance to CSW himself via email. People make mistakes as that's life but Greg Maxwell has always claimed he knew CSW was a conman... yet offered Craig Wright assistance in an attempt to attack BCH. It's just the kind of stand up guy he is. When you bring up Maxwell emailing Craight Wright he'll leave the discussion instead of denying it, everytime.

Oh and of course there's Maxwell's long history of disrupting communities such as vandalizing Wikipedia, being caught manipulating and sockpuppeting on wikipedia which is readily available via Wikipedia's moderation logs. You can google this with 3 words and verify it yourself.

And lastly since this is the most recent event Greg Maxwell was again trying to make waves here and false claims that he was banned in /r/btc and had a big out with BicoinXio about 1-2 months back leading to BitcoinXio's ban. Basically Maxwell accused /r/btc of being censored which he could have proved simply by showing us a single comment posted in /r/btc from his profile that wasn't showing in /r/btc. He could not. BitcoinXio naturally made him a laughing stock and got mass reported by bots. However before he was banned, he sent me the private conversation from Nullc and him where Maxwell claimed automoderator was censoring him. ~~DM me~~ and [I'll link you the conversation showing Maxwell's true colors and his accusations of him getting banned and the content which he most likely used to get BitcoinXio banned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/kn25yb/an_insight_into_the_mind_of_greg_maxwell_nullc/ghi3358/) It's actually quite hilarious to see Nullc acting so calm in public and then going irate with his false accusations and BitcoinXio making him look like the joke he is. 

u/1mightbeapenguin found a great post proving Nullc knows how the automoderator works despite making his recent claims and that comments getting banned do indeed show up in the public mod log. Nice find Penguin!

That's basically the summary of the drama that's going on here. Maxwell is stirring the pot and sowing discord where he can. Also just a heads up if you post many of these sources you'll get mass reported and your account banned. **I full expect to have my account banned soon after this post for laying out the facts but who gives a shit when accounts are free and karma doesn't matter. The truth is what matters.** 

Also please read this thread with removeedit.com because I full expect this thread to get mass reported as well.

I wonder what [Barely Sociable](https://twitter.com/SociableBarely/status/1344006683878543360) has to say on the matter?

Also, why would Roger / [Bitcoin.com](https://Bitcoin.com) promote the idea of Adam Back being Satoshi when they're  ideologically opposed? This is a pretty weak conspiracy theory.
> ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist.""

Or in this case, Greg Maxwell plays all innocent and the victim when he is one of the biggest trolls and orchestrators of the destruction of Bitcoin in it's entirety. Just look at Maxwell's history: [Wikipedia Admins: ""[Gregory Maxwell of Blockstream Core] is a very dangerous individual"" ""has for some time been behaving very oddly and aggressively""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/74se80/wikipedia_admins_gregory_maxwell_of_blockstream/)

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Once you start to look deeper, you see how he worked with Theymos on BitcoinTalk, working in unison on manipulating the forum and later /r/Bitcoin to mass-censor in order to push a narrative. Maxwell was caught in [verified email leaks working with government agents](https://web.archive.org/web/20140418185452/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=335658.0) on how to force small blocks onto the Bitcoin community when it was still relatively small after Satoshi left. 

[""Blockstream can't be evil.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/kmhavp/blockstream_cant_be_evil_7_years_later/) Greg Maxwell is the co-founder Blockstream. Oh yeah, they are evil!"

908	While the Bitcoin Core developers have been talking about Schnorr signatures for years, Bitcoin Cash has already had them for years.	1612984554.0	128	"I know I will be downvoted to hell for saying this but didn‚Äôt the code of Schnorr sigs that BCH uses is written by Bitcoin Core developers? Is it really fair to celebrate on adapting sth from them and saying BCH had it earlier?

BCH has many native improvements written by the deva for BCH alone, why not front run with those achievements over this?
The reason why Schnorr signatures were not originally used in Bitcoin goes back to the original standardization of DSA by NIST, the US government standards bureau. Under pressure from NSA,  Schnorr's original proposal was replaced by a more complicated algorithm for reasons that were never satisfactorily explained. 

What were these reasons?  One public reason was patents, but this is no longer relevant since these have since expired.  The likely reason is certain subtle technical properties of Schnorr's aglorithm. These include homomorphic properties that make it possible to achieve certain privacy properies.  These properties were removed when Schnorr's original proposal was modified to become DSA.  Later, when these basic cryptographic algorithms were moved to Elliptic curves, the DSA algorithm became the ECDSA algorithm, as adapted to the particular elliptic curve chosen by Satoshi. 

By reinstating Schnorr signatures Bitcoin Cash has made it possible to regain some of the excluded privacy advantages, such as multi-party signatures that are indistinguishable from single party signatures on the block chain.  These advantages have not yet percolated up to client software and application programs, but they are presently part  of the Bitcoin Cash infrastructure.
And they likely never will get them.  They have a huge fear of hard forks.  It would be a hard forking change because existing nodes would not be able to validate the sigs. Unless they can figure out how to do it with another weird and wacky soft-fork hack, a-la segshit."

Let me elaborate for those who have been told that Bitcoin Cash is a scam.

It is not.

It is the result of years and years of trying to convince the BTC community that scaling was necessary.

Ultimately, some Bitcoin developers and miners decided before letting Blockstream & Core halt proper scaling and wreck the project further with SegWit and LN and other non-solutions to the main issue (capacity), that they needed to split up.

So Bitcoin Cash was created in 2017 by splitting off in the most fair way possible for users. Everyone who had BTC, automatically held the same amount of BCH. No premine, no privileged groups of developers taxing the protocol and deciding for others.

Bitcoin Cash shares the history of the blockchain from 2017 right to the genesis block.

It rejected the corporate takeover and artificial quota on blockspace that was  Blockstream and Bitcoin Core tried to push on Bitcoin via censorship and other dirty tricks.

Today, it has a lower market cap, but make no mistake - Bitcoin Cash has the 'magic' ingredients that made Bitcoin successful.

It works as peer to peer electronic cash should, and can be both a medium of exchange and store of value, as Bitcoin was always intended to be.

/endwalloftext
>to bring the control of money back to the people.

It never was in the hands of the people, ever, in the history of civilizations
>**It withstood the hostile takeover attempt by BTC and the banks.**

I mean... in the sense that bitcoin cash still exists, yeah. But sadly, blockstream and other advocates for segwit and LN were successful in their ""takeover"".

There is hope, we still have bitcoin cash and BCH daily transactions have just recently overtaken segwitcoin's (yay!) and a lot of developers are working on it to actually fulfil satoshis vision, but to say that it 'withstood the hostile takeover' is a stretch.

In fact, I'd say it's categorically incorrect simply because the bitcoin that people know today is not the original bitcoin. It should be, but it's not. The thing that the average Joe calls bitcoin is segwitcoin and not BCH. The takeover was successful.

If BCH was the big boi trading at $45k+ under the ticker ""BTC"" then I would agree that it withstood the takeover.

Still, BCH prevails and I'll continue to stand by it."

954	Zero-Confirmation Escrows (ZCEs) ‚Äì Instant, Secure Payments on Bitcoin Cash (new CHIP + reference implementation)	1629392204.0	118	"Hi all,

A new Cash Improvement Proposal (CHIP) is now available: [`CHIP-2021-08-ZCE: Zero-Confirmation Escrows`](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-zce).

**Zero-Confirmation Escrows** (ZCEs) are contracts which enable instant, incentive-secure payments on Bitcoin Cash. They're particularly useful in point-of-sale, ATM, and vending applications where payers have no prior or ongoing relationship with the payee.

Supporting wallets can add ZCEs to transactions to guarantee that the transaction will not be double-spent. Wallets can instantly make a long series of ZCE-secured payments using the same starting funds, and ZCEs require no holding periods or other delays in wallet user experiences.

ZCEs are a refinement of [prior work](https://gist.github.com/awemany/619a5722d129dec25abf5de211d971bd#prior-art) made possible by improved contract tooling and the implementation of Double Spend Proofs (DSP) on the Bitcoin Cash network. They require no consensus changes and can be deployed without coordination. Once a critical mass of miners implement ZCE-claiming code, businesses can safely accept ZCE-secured transactions without delaying the payment experience to monitor the network.

Both the draft specification and reference implementation are available on GitHub: [https://github.com/bitjson/bch-zce](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-zce)

Reviews and feedback are deeply appreciated. Please open [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-zce/issues) or join the [discussion on Bitcoin Cash Research](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-08-zces-zero-confirmation-escrows/537). Thanks!

No one will use a coin which requires calculation lower than 0.01 cost while buying chocolate. All this coins are make sense just for profiting. After couple years I bet everyone will forget todays coins and newer ones will be more practical. And makes more sense in daily usage.

It's just logical: if people can use a coin, they do (surprise surprise).

BTC fees now at $17 and trending higher.

BCH fees flat at 1 sat / byte.

BCH now doing 6B USD / day vs 18 - 35B / day for BTC.  So about 16-33% of the USD value transacted, at only about 1.5% the price.

The market is going to catch on at some point, and it's going to be very bad news for BTC when it does.

We might not see the price deflate that rapidly, but it'll be institutional investors buying up blocks of coins to stick in a vault because Tesla did while all the real users and commerce flocks to BCH.
These are some exciting times! BCH can process transactions without breaking a sweat. I also welcome ""spam attackers"" to prove the chain is unscalable lol

The half a cent is quite a % price increase though, it was a tenth of a cent until recently. If I understand correctly if the price of BCH doubles again the price per transaction will be over a cent. For poorer countries this starts having a noticable impact, and multi-transactions start chipping into their low income.

Will miner fees be adjusted to the increase in price and increase transaction volume?

I mean it is still infinitely better than BTC, but transaction price should be kept as low as possible, with miners paid via sheer volume over higher fees.

998	Is bitcoin cash being adopted as a medium of exchange faster than bitcoin itself?	1620176256.0	115	"why would anyone pay $8 fee to use BTC at a store?
Bitcoin Cash is ""Bitcoin itself""

Because Bitcoin is more than just a ticker symbol, it's an idea for a [Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf) that allows any two willing parties to make causal, cashlike transactions with no need for a financial intermediary.  That's BCH.

BTC on the other hand has rejected the original vision of Bitcoin in favor of a ""layered"" model where the blockchain is not used for casual, cashlike transactions; but for infrequent, large-value settlement transactions.  In this model, casual transactions are no longer cashlike, but facilitated by a network of financial middlement known as ""Lightning Network.""

I think this watered-down vision where middlemen are once again required in order for normal people to make normal-sized transactions is boring and frankly it stinks to high heaven.  That's why in 2017 myself and thousands of other people chose a different upgrade path for Bitcoin that preserved the original vision of Bitcoin as Cash.
""  I plan on holding my btc until I can freely spend it without having to convert it to fiat ""

that could pose some problems. because of the artificially constrained transaction thruput on btc, fees are expected to continue going up. prominent btc ""thought leaders"" predict and encourage fees in the hundreds of dollars for a single transaction. that may limit your ability to ""spend freely""."

Yeah that happened in 2017, when Bitcoin upgraded to BCH, you are welcome, dumbass.
I think Amir is a bit hyperbolic, but correct in his assessment.

>Truth is these problems start with lack of vision and long-term roadmap, not with the processes themselves.

The roadmap for BTC is necessarily pretty constrained when it can't hard fork and can't fix the most glaring issue staring it in the face. It makes sense that they have no vision or long-term roadmap. Everyone who had those ideas has left for other projects.

> the Bitcoin Core monopoly created this situation; one coin, one client, one vision. And the inevitable infighting for ultimate power.

Yup.

> there should be a long period of self reflection about where the problems began rather than patching some process and moving on.
