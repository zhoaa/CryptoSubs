I'm prone to getting up with hype (and I AM hyped about DOGE) but serious question:  What have ""they"" (experts, people who know, etc.) said is the likely trajectory of DOGE?  Bitcoin being north of 55K was unthinking just a few years ago.  Does DOGE have the kind of legs to run well beyond $1?  Is the focus on $1 just a first major milestone?  Can you point to sources that discuss this?

Thank you for interacting!"

For his children, I haven’t ever heard anyone say he’s a good father. I don’t see how he could be “present” in their lives with his schedule.

1 dollar would be an amazing vacation 10 dollars would be a down payment on a house 1 hundred dollars would be nearly life changing 420.69 and you’re all invited in my yacht
To me it is another bank account I don't sell my dollar bills and I don't plan on selling doge.. just waiting for more people to accept it so I can spend it and buy more."
10	The majority of yal	1620672597.0	54475	"The past few weeks, several hundred thousand people joined this sub
And they are not among the +900% folks..

just like me, many bought in at   .20 or higher.

Quite a lot of them are currently in the red, bc they bought at 0.60 or higher.


Some prolly sold during the dip and lost money...


Would've loved to see their faces when SpaceX tweeted about DOGE-1 launch. lol

the coin will go up and up and up the closer we get to that launch.


and there will be dip after dip after dip, because that's how the rich get richer.
A whale sold at a very strategic time, causing a large drop followed by another drop as stop loss orders and panic sellers sold.

The price was bouncing back quickly when suddenly we start seeing a flood of articles about how Elon said dogecoin was a ""hustle"" or a ""scam"" along with a lot of doomsaying about how this is the end for dogecoin. Not to mention some other dog coin suddenly emerging from nowhere as the next big thing.

And now today doge is steadily declining, but so are many other altcoins. Almost seems like someone is trying to manipulate our thinking.

But I zoomed out and noticed we're still up 20% from 7 days ago, so I bought some more.
Not everyone invested at 0.05. Many bought it at 0.5 or 0.6 or 0.7 too - because of the active community. They of course feel regretful. Don't try to hurt their emotions in anyway."
11	TRUTH	1620599390.0	53977	"If 1000 doge will get me to be a millionaire I will like and hodl! 

Edit: I would like to edit this and say that I am currently purchasing a few coins (approximately $20-$30) each Friday when I get paid. But I don’t have a lot of expendable money to use - life is expensive! I’m doing what I can though and I’m hodling!

Edit 2: dollar signs $$$
I will probably not be millionaire but ok
I'm still an xxx HODLer, so repping the hundred-thousand-aires who're still supporting but will be stuck in low earth orbit for now."

Never sell again.  Already lost in the move from .06 to .30.  Can't time this thing.  Moving too fast.  You'll end up buying back higher than what you sold for.  You could average in, like buy more each time it moves a couple cents up.  [ edit:  I couldn't believe the up votes.  My phone's been going crazy.  I must have struck a nerve.  A lot of us have tried to time and would have been better off just hodling.  And save capital gains.  Looking to try to use as currency, then price will go higher bc institutions will want to get in on profits.]
Some amount of people will sell it immediately at 1$🤔.
But most people will just hold and watch next growth. 💵✈️"

27	DOGE: Are you ready?	1612162902.0	39061	"Full quote from Elon Musk on Clubhouse: ""Occasionally I make jokes about Dogecoin but they are really just meant to be jokes. But Dogecoin was made as a joke to make fun of cryptocurrencies. Obviously. But fate loves irony and often the most ironic outcome is the most likely, or the most entertaining outcome is often the most likely. And arguably the most entertaining outcome and most ironic outcome would be if Dogecoin becomes the currency of earth in the future.""

The fact that you made this so fast, I find amazing. Nicely done my dude.

31	This is such a good idea. 🚀	1621161470.0	37090	"Until there is less price volatility - this is a bad idea for a small business.
Instead of just asking small shops to accept Dogecoin we should be telling them how to accept Dogecoin. Most probably don't know how or are too intimated to get started. Spread the good word.
Great post. Perhaps, very stupid question... how can my small bz accept doge or any cryprto???  Our pos system  is not equipped and our cpa is not in the loop. Please advise."
32	Americans when they see that Europeans failed to make doge 0.50$ when they were sleeping	1618574807.0	36880	"They did hold the floor though, have to give them that!
Outside of America, still few people know about what is happening with Dogecoin.  I am from Russia, and among my friends, I am the only one who told them about the growth of Doge.  Sorry for my English
Europeans wanted to, but the banks were closed and they won’t let the transaction go till the next day. Also, Banks are closed through the weekend. Doge might see a dip, but it will bounce very strong the next week."
33	I’m crying. Thank you so much. I just paid all of my debts at 24 years old.	1619886239.0	36221	"Badass! Congratulations to you. Just a reminder that I’m sure you already know but don’t forget about capital gains tax when it comes to your taxes next year. I would suggest keeping 20k just in your bank account to make sure you cover it.
I just experienced two emotions simultaneously... First one was happiness... I am extremely happy for you! That is amazing and inspirational to say the least! The other emotion I felt was anger... It is just infuriating that the system is set up to create so much debt that without hitting the lottery or coming across some other stroke of luck such as being an early investor in Doge equates to an otherwise insurmountable debt. 

A 24 year old should not have to say ""I just paid off all of my debts at 24 years old"", because a 24 year old should not have such a large debt, but our society is set up to trap it's people into debt like this and that... that is just infuriating to me...

Congrats!
I'm so proud of you! This gives me hope for the future. I'm hoping that the 1k doge I was able to afford will be able to at least make a dent in mine, and help me afford the starting costs for my service doge through a program near me. Here's to keeping my fingers crossed"
34	Dogecoin is now the most mentioned cryptocurrency on Twitter ever. Let's go!! 🚀👨‍🚀👩‍🚀	1611937405.0	35443	"3dit: 🚀⚡️
I bought $5K avg .068! That’s 64K And Holding to the moon!! I don’t want to be rich, I want to be Fucking Wealthy!!
  

Why its going down. Read !!!!!!!!! 

IF YOU HAVE MONEY IN DOGE THEN READ THIS!!!

The only reason that it’s staggering is because free trading brokerages like Robinhood are making you wait until your deposits go through, which takes up to 5 days, so ALLL of these people who WANT to put in CANT because their deposits have not gone through. SO DO NOT SELL. HOLD HOLD HOLD. Once these boys’ deposits come through we’ll be by mid week next week!!!

In at 0.36 just before Doge day so I could be a part of it. And FOMO. 

HODL over here. 

I like the dip, if it goes below $0.10 I'll know to buy more. 

I'm into crypto now I guess 🤷🏼‍♂️"

Sold $0.00 and I’m down $27,000.00 since .74.
If I can HODL, you can too. It’s cuz I know every doge has its day, and it ain’t happened yet.
Unless I’m way off here, this dip is to be expected. Whales are toying with the market. Driving prices down, then buying like crazy which creates another upward trajectory, then selling at the top.... rinse wash repeat. If I’m wrong, the I lose a couple grand.

Think less of a one-day boost and more about steady gains.  If it goes up like, 1 or 2% a day, that's not going to lead to people panic selling. But it's still phenomenal for growth.

We saw NewEgg announce that they'll start accepting Doge as payment.

We've still yet to see what SlimJim has been making all their hype about.

And that's just _today_.  We've yet to see Dogecoin get onto Coinbase, and yet to see it accepted at a bunch of other popular online retailers.

Man I’ve been in this subreddit since 2014. It’s never been anything but positive. Especially when you consider the silly things we did: Jamaican Bobseld team, sponsoring nascar racer, etc. I’ve absolutely loved it. 

I was planning on making my own post later today in hopes of trying to get this subreddit back on track. We need more of the good, and far less of the bad.

We as a community need to stop upvoting the obvious karma farming and low effort posts. I’m talking about you “WHOS HOLDING TIL X”, “hands up if you’re not selling until Y”, etc. it’s awful, it’s tacky, and it does nothing but make r/Dogecoin look like a pump and dump coin. which it is not. 

Could doge hit $0.5, $1, even $10?? Who knows. 

All i know is i want the community to come back to its roots. This isnt a get rich quick scheme. This is an amazing community that does incredible things for others. Lets bring it back.

*Quick edit as this is gaining traction*

Below I would love it if everyone commented ways we could bring the community back to its roots, and even expand on them. Especially considering the newfound wealth we’ve gained with such an insane rise! With a better community, we’ll have a higher chance of Dogecoin adoption and more meaningful growth for the coin itself. I know it’s not original, but my favorite things we’ve done are helping the underdoges. 

How do **you** think we can help the underdoge?"

100	6 years ago I traded my Xbox for 1.15 Million Doge - Today that Doge is worth over $163,000	1618414332.0	23672	"No, you know exactly what you’re doing.
Linking to the transaction below.

I listed it for 750,000 dogecoin but the price of doge was falling so fast at the time that we finally closed it for 1.15 million doge.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/27wrsr/sg\_xbox\_one\_new\_in\_box\_for\_only\_750000\_doge\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket/comments/27wrsr/sg_xbox_one_new_in_box_for_only_750000_doge_with/)

A few months later the value of dogecoin had plummeted and I was left with about 1/3 the value of an xbox. I posted it here and you can read in the comments that people were sad at my bad luck at the time. Note it was sold for 1.15M doge but I had another 50K from mining so I accidently wrote 1.2M

[https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2t8mmp/when\_i\_sold\_my\_xbox\_one\_for\_12\_million\_doge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2t8mmp/when_i_sold_my_xbox_one_for_12_million_doge/)

If anyone is interested I can show the actual transactions of the doge going through the blockchain. I had thought it was 1.2 or 1.3 million but when I went to my wallet I saw it was actually 1,150,000. I had also mined some and traded some BTC for some.

After this doge continued to fall and I lost over 85% of the value. I traded around a bit and even lost a lot due to some bad trades. [https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7xrxmg/dogecoin\_trading\_fail\_turned\_12m\_dogecoin\_into\_7m/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/7xrxmg/dogecoin_trading_fail_turned_12m_dogecoin_into_7m/)

After this the price continued to fall and I traded back into it and ended up with the full 1.15 million plus some. I then got locked out of my account for a few years and just got back in going into the 2021 runup.

I am still looking for the old wallet address so I can prove this. However I did post about this later that same year which was 6 years ago.

OK so this is getting a lot of attention so I will put some FAQs up here.

1. If you want to buy dogecoin with dollars I recommend the robinhood app.  Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Other people like coinbase but I have not used them.
2. If you want to trade dogecoin for bitcoin or other crypto I recommend bittrex or kraken. Binance is the largest doge site but I have not used it much. These are websites not apps. Try to think of dogecoin in terms of bitcoin and satoshi instead of dollars when trading.
3. If you want to sell stuff for dogecoin goto /r/dogemarket
4. You can still mine doge on your computer but sadly this is not as efficient and you may need to buy an ASIC. See /r/dogemining I no longer mine dogecoin but I am still mining ethereum
5. Dogecoin is not losing value - it skyrocketed up over 45,000% since my trade but it is very volatile. It was worth about 1/3 a few months after I bought it. Don't mortgage your house and buy dogecoin. The supply of dogecoin is 127 Billion coins but most of this was distributed in the first year and a lot of it has been lost forever. This year the supply will increase by about 4% but I would guess 4% or more will be lost this year in misplaced wallets. The increase in supply is decreasing so in future years it will only produce 3 then 2 then 1% and less each year.
6. The dogecoin community held a video contest to promote dogecoin in 2014 and this was the winner. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=000al7ru3ms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=000al7ru3ms)
7. Dogecoin is unique among all crytocurrencies for many reasons including:
   1. It was the first coin to not cap the supply. About 5 billion new coins are made every year. In 10 years time this will be less than 2.9% new coins every year so supply will not outpace inflation. Instead there is continue reasons to keep mining and new supply means people do not have to hoard.
   2. They were so easy to come by in the early years and worth so little that people were giving them away thousands at a time. This led to people actually using dogecoin instead of hoarding it like bitcoin. There is documented proof of one person giving away 14 million dogecoin to fund the building of water wells.
   3. The block time is 1 minute so transaction on dogecoin are way faster than most other coins. It can some times take ten times longer and cost $40 or more to move coins other cryptocurrencies.
   4. In the early years dogecoin was used as a vehicle to do good like fund the jamaican bobsled team in the Sochi olympics, the dogecoin nascar team, and to fund building water wells in africa. Proof as no one believes me?
      1. Jamaican bobsled team [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/22/265060754/wow-dogecoin-other-donors-send-jamaican-bobsled-team-to-sochi](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/22/265060754/wow-dogecoin-other-donors-send-jamaican-bobsled-team-to-sochi)
      2. Dogecoin Nascar [https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/tech/web/nascar-dogecoin-talladega/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/tech/web/nascar-dogecoin-talladega/index.html)
      3. Dogecoin wells in Kenya [https://www.coindesk.com/dogecoin-foundation-raise-50k-kenya-water-crisis](https://www.coindesk.com/dogecoin-foundation-raise-50k-kenya-water-crisis)
8. Dogecoin rose 300% on launch day then fell 80% immediatly afterwards. During this time miners were rewarded with 1 to 1 million dogecoin for solving the block rewards every minute.
9. You can see the price history of dogecoin here: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/)Take a look at the price in  2014.
10. The early dogecoin community got very mad when wolong proved he had the ability to manipulate the price of dogecoin by buying and selling millions of coins at a time to himself.  There are many old posts on reddit talking about how wolong ruined dogecoin and the coin was dead forever. Many thought the community was ruined but wolong disapeared and the community went on without him.
11. I think dogecoin is fun crypto to play with but not a wise investment. It has a history of market manipulation and pumping and dumping. 

Now people think I am making up these stories so here is proof:

Jamaican bobsled team: [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/22/265060754/wow-dogecoin-other-donors-send-jamaican-bobsled-team-to-sochi](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/22/265060754/wow-dogecoin-other-donors-send-jamaican-bobsled-team-to-sochi)

If you look at the weekly chart you will notice this dip we are in is very similar to the dip we had after the big spike in mid-April. This is a normal healthy correction after such a huge rise. I dont know if that means if Doge will goto the moon next week or if it will take a month or 2 but it will go back up again. $1 is inevitable.
It's funny because Doge is still doing incredible all things considered. It's fairly normal for a large correction to occur after such an increase. The fact that it's maintaining above 0.5 is nothing short of impressive."

For everyone reading. This is how we make something out of Doge! Promote businesses the accept doge!!! 

Also I paid my personal trainer in doge at 6-7 cents. 
He is very happy with me so I get two cheat days a month week instead of one. Lol

TO ALL NEWCOMERS:   


This is not GME yall. People expecting doge to hit anywhere near $10 or even $5 this year are wayyyy too naive. Realistically we're looking at doge trading somewhere between $1 - $3 by year end..and thats IF everything goes well without huge cashouts from those invested@ <0.001

$3 - $5 in 2022 and maybe $6-$9 by 2023 year end.

The only way dogecoin becomes adopted as the actual coin of the internet is if we get as many establishments and businesses on board with accepting dogecoin for payment/transaction processes. Doge being accepted in exchange for goods and services is the only thing that will give the currency any staying power. Otherwise it'll just crash once the whales stop the hype train.

All memes aside this is definitely a long term hold investment and if you're one of those people pumping thousands of life savings into a meme coin expecting to get rich overnight..prepare to be very disappointed.

Mark Cuban: Dallas Mavericks accept Doge

Mark Cuban: Spends time on Ellen talking about Doge.

Doge: Nothing.

Elon Musk.

Doge: To the moon!

Seriously, Mark Cuban has done more for Doge in actuality than Elon Musk has but just doesn't get the love.

:(

EDIT: Don't get me wrong, I've been a big fan of Elon Musk for a few years now. If anyone has ever read Michael Flynn's ""Firestar"" book, you'll understand. Elon, regardless of his crazy antics, is really taking us places.

No point in selling at $1. No point in selling at $10. Maybe liquidating a percentage so you can get your initial investment back and some tendies is good. If it goes higher and higher or gets extremely close to the cap, you're gonna regret selling out. We set a new floor this year for doge.

But either way I support all the positive aspects of the Dogecoin community - that includes the memes and the overall silliness and fun! I think this subreddit has a lot of good energy that I really like :)

***If you ware watching the crypto's price chart, i.e. doge, you may notice that there are 0.001(+/-) selling and buying occurring. If you are wondering what this could mean, simple. It's possible newer coins are being added, it's a small correction, or whales are trying to trigger a panic sale.***

If it's a whale, guarantee they will buy back all there shares. And if they are trying to trigger panic sales so that they have a newer low buy-in then in the long run, they will only hurt their income because they have to keep doing that

***A lot of stocks and commodities are going through risk. So, just look away from your phone. If you are tempted to buy, than feel free to do so, buy as low as you can.***

***With that being said, this is a clear sign of stability and high growth potential. We are the underdoge, and we will send doge beyond the moon. HODL*** 💎🐾🐕🚀🌕

I think the issue is that a lot of new investors have come along because of the simplicity of apps bringing in a new generation of investors, especially Gen Z. But they don’t understand how markets work. Crypto has cycles that are a more exaggerated version of the stock market, but if you can just hold it will be worth it. Doge is a long term investment. I wish someone would have told me that when I lost money on Bitcoin years ago. I remember it dipping and essentially the same situation we have today.

1.  Read this to the bottom:

2.  If price movement scares you.  Change view settings to week or month.

3.  www.dogemyths.com 

*the goal/purpose was/is being able to use DOGE as currency in exchange for goods and services as a replacement to government backed fiat/paper currency which controls people.  If you own businesses, accept DOGE.  Look to purchase things from places that only take DOGE.  Then the movement REALLY snowballs.  Won't happen overnight, but it's happening.  God bless you all. ✌.  Peace #dogecoin #thepeoplescurrency #DoOnlyGoodEveryday #DOGEHISTORY

PS.  DOGE started as a joke... And for smiles and laughs and levity.  That's why the memes are so clever and hilarious.  Don't lose that when you are blessed with money.  Don't take yourself too seriously, be humble, gracious, and generous with others.  Like in the movie Captain America, DOGE amplifies who you are... Good or bad.  * remember, we won't be around forever, love one another."

I had this happen to me and the bank had my paycheck process one minute after they hit me with the overdraft.

The ensuing phone call to try and correct the situation made me decide to take my finances to another bank. While some definitely can't manage money, predatory banks don't help the situation.
Use ALLY Bank, they got rid of overdraft fees. They are starting to get more attention finally, the lack of physical branches means they don't need to charge ridiculous fees like overdrafts.

Questions from a Newbie. 

I don’t know crap about Crypto. Been reading and trying to learn but there is so much back and forth a simple fella like me don’t know what to believe. I am pretty much the same on stocks and the stock market. From what I have seen, the overall “short term investments” seem to be emotionally driven. Hence GME, the brief silver jump, and the other Reddit driven stocks. 

Now, a friend of mine told me a couple of months ago about this Doge stuff. I bought in at like .0097 and actually forgot about it until the GME hype. I came to Reddit to see what was up and stumbled across these forums and remembered I bought in to Doge, went and checked my RH account and was very pleasantly surprised. Bought in again at .04 and at .05. 

So here is my questions:

1) there seems to be as much negativity as there is positivity about the Doge. Why is there so many people trying to convince others it is not worth investing in when there has been a trend, granted it is relatively new, of moving in the right direction? I am proud to say a large portion of my investment has jumped 500%.

2) Musk, Simmons, Cuban are all noticing Doge. In an emotionally driven world this is a good thing right?

3) I noticed on my brokerage account my state was not listed as approving crypto or something along this lines. What the heck does that mean? When I decide to sell am I going to be able to get my $$$$?

4) what is meant by wallets? I saw where someone said to make multiple wallets. What does that mean?

5) I have been waiting for a dip to buy some more but it does not look like that is happening. thoughts on buying more at current price? Should I wait for a peak, sell, and get back in when it dips again?

6) is the Musk Super Bowl commercial legit? Is it real? You would Think we will see a big jump after it airs correct?

As I said, I am new to this stuff. I traditionally invest in real estate and things I can touch but I am intrigued by this stuff. The Bitcoin thing just blew me away. Wish I would have got in on that one. Maybe Doge will be my 2nd chance.

Do you guys honestly not understand the market cap that would give doge? 40 cents was 50 billion dollars. 10 dollar doge would mean a 2 trillion market cap. Roughly the size of the entire crypto market durring the last high. I'm not trying to throw mud at you guys, I have doge and am rooting for it. I just don't want people to risk everything on a dream that is very unlikely to happen. Do your own research and look up what markets have 2 trillion evaluations. Something like 80% of all the doge in the world is held by 3 wallets. Thats means that the current price action relies on the whims of 3 people.

327	Robinhood	1613465026.0	13584	"RH owns all your Coins, you can NOT use them, because your Coins are stored in their cold wallet

so who ever buys via RH or other CryptoTOKEN exchange, is freezing their DOGE in someone else’s cold wallet, with NO ACCESS to it.

That’s what Elon means by “too much concentration is the real issue”

CryptoCURRENCIES need free Circulation. You cannot use a coin as a currency if it’s assets are inaccessible to their users.

RH wouldn’t be a whale if they distributed the Coins to their real owners.

Use Binance or similar instead.

No financial advice, just DOGEshit talking

EDIT: if you switch to binance, you can use my referral link    Z6Z6CF7B     (you’ll earn 5% of the promotion)

EDIT II: you can also force RH to let you transfer your coins straight from RH to a private wallet.
It seems article 12 of their Terms state that you should have access to withdraw your currency without cashing out.
There’s a reddit rn, where they discuss it deeply

Read this to see how you could avoid cashing out:

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/llaj7t/about_robhinhood_better_solution_than_selling_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

EDIT III: RH IS WORKING ON ENABELING WITHDRAWLS OF YOUR CRYPTOCURRENCYS, as of now.
So I would wait fir them to enable withdrawls in crypto, but still change exchange and send Coins to private wallets as soon as they let you - so papa Elon will be proud of you

And from there on ... to the Moooooon 🐶 

EDIT IV: I used to buy into cryptos (BTC or ETH) via kraken and coinbase and then send it to binance to trade there. From binance i sent to private wallets. I returned my cryptofunds (via ETH)  to kraken, when I wanted to cash out.
I’m from Europe, so I don’t know how convenient this is for US.
It also took me 2-3 weeks to have everything setup and verified correctly.

330	HOLY LIFT OFF	1613913178.0	13501	"It did not move
Is doge supposed to make us money or be our money? It would be difficult to do both. I wouldn’t want to accept doge as payment if it can lose 20% value in a day, even if it can grow 20% as well. How can you plan a business and know whether you can pay employees at end of week if value can just disappear. It cannot become global currency in this state. If it grows too high then it will be limited to wealthy to buy in and use it. If it doesn’t maintain a low value then might as well use Bitcoin with all of its .00000000x.
If there is a vision of crypto truly becoming the currency of earth then is there an existing one that can be leveraged and has high adoption? Yes... doge.
When I see that tweet... “should we?”  I think it is addressing this issue.  Investment with profit or do we really want doge to be used as currency.

Btw. This is my first post on Reddit but have been following doge and am torn about making money with doge and seeing doge flourish as a legit currency.

How much is your stash worth at the moment? 1 million is a good amount.
LISTEN EVERYBODY: There’s a lot of people on here who have no idea what the hell they are talking about. DO NOT SELL. You will regret it later. The apps are crashing because hundreds of thousands of people are trying to buy. Robinhood isn’t allowing instant transfers because they can’t afford to loan everybody money while the bank processes your deposit. This common practice. It’s always been like this for years. Anybody who tells you different is dumb money and has no idea what they’re saying. You can buy doge once your money clears. THE PRICE IS GOING TO SKY ROCKET. SCREW THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀➡️🪐

We are the pioneers. WE (400,000 who are in this thread) DECIDE THE PRICE.

We have a chance for generational wealth. Don’t be stupid.

THIS IS FOR THE HOLDERS: I have a plan. Hear me out. If you agree; upvote

Let’s all collectively agree to set the floor at .05. The majority of people here should have purchased their dogecoin below this price.

This means that if we buy anytime it starts to dip under .05 it will raise back to at least that threshold. it doesn’t have to be much 5 dollars by 400,000 people is monumental.

Next step. When it reaches $1 sell EXACTLY 10% of your coin. NOT all. This way we can get some net profit no matter what happens. So if In the off chance it does completely crash you already made profit. Since the 10% will cover your initial investment and some change.

After that the remaining 90% just HOLD YOUR ROCKET 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TO THE STARS

Been buying Doge for the past 3 years. About a year ago I said if it hit .01 I would be pretty stoked. Seeing what it’s been doing, and what it’s holding at today reassured me that it will eventually grow bigger. Just at a slow and steady pace, and I’m okay with that.

 To get to the moon will be a long process. We have to use the coins. A  currencies value is backed by the economy behind it so if we want to  increase the price we have to buy and sell things with doge"
375	Raise your paw if dogecoin is going to the moon!!!!	1612329498.0	12383	"Can I get EVERYONE'S commitment that we will not sell til at LEAST $1.00 

LET'S all make money & make DOGECOIN forever. 

Absolutely do not sell all of it at $1.00 if we all sell all the dogecoins at a dollar it just goes back down to .01 again. 

Here's a good plan: 

At $1.00 sell 10% of your dogecoin. You made mad profit off your initial investment and you still have thousands of dogecoins that can appreciate to greater value. Remember the bigger picture is to the moon. We don't get to the moon if we sell at a penny profit. 

So, do this with me my friends. Sell only 10% of your dogecoins after we hit $1.00 And keep HOLDING the other 90% you purchased.

I’m taking legal action against RobinHood. I contacted a firm in NY today. 

I still can’t  purchase DOGE. I have funds that cleared my bank and is showing as buying power on Robinhood app. When I go to buy DOGE, it says I have ZERO buying power. I have pictures and videos as proof. 

My thought - who else can’t buy? How many people? Why not? How has this affected price per share? Restricting the purchase of DOGE stopped the run IMO because people can’t buy!!! 

We should be compensated based on projections. This is infuriating.

I’m sure there are some examples some companies having rival ones, or joke companies end up being #1. (Like with The Boring Company for instance)

DO NOT SELL. You will regret it later. The apps are crashing because hundreds of thousands of people are trying to buy. Robinhood isn’t allowing instant transfers because they can’t afford to loan everybody money while the bank processes your deposit. This common practice. It’s always been like this for years. Anybody who tells you different is dumb money and has no idea what they’re saying. You can buy doge once your money clears. THE PRICE IS GOING TO SKY ROCKET. SCREW THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀➡️🪐

We are the pioneers. WE (400,000 who are in this thread) DECIDE THE PRICE.

We have a chance for generational wealth. Don’t be stupid.

THIS IS FOR THE HOLDERS: I have a plan. Hear me out. If you agree; upvote

Let’s all collectively agree to set the floor at .05. The majority of people here should have purchased their dogecoin below this price.

This means that if we buy anytime it starts to dip under .05 it will raise back to at least that threshold. it doesn’t have to be much 5 dollars by 400,000 people is monumental.

Next step. When it reaches $1 sell EXACTLY 10% of your coin. NOT all. This way we can get some net profit no matter what happens. So if In the off chance it does completely crash you already made profit. Since the 10% will cover your initial investment and some change.

After that the remaining 90% just HOLD YOUR ROCKET 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TO THE STARS

$100 actually isn’t out of the realm of possibility.  Crypto is just now being integrated into the mainstream economy. Many trillions will flow into the crypto marketplace in the coming years and much of it will be concentrated in the cryptos with the most utility.  If The Doge secures its spot among the world’s primary cryptos (which it may already have), then $100 dollars could most certainly happen.  We are in the beginning stages of tradable digital assets becoming integrated into the lives of everyday people.  The potential here is absolutely insane
One step at a time. $1 is an achievable goal for now. When we hit it, our next goal should be $4.20, then $10, then $69, and so on. Keep your goals in short-term, achievable chunks aligned with your overall strategy."

This is insanely impressive. As someone else said, this is Times Magazine cover-worthy. Most memes and Photoshops are funny yet cringy, but this is next level legitimate. 

We are all already riding the DOGE train and loving it (HODL4LYF) but an installation like this will truly pique the interest of the average member of the public: the exact demographic that we would like to make aware of DOGE. 

Where is this installation? Is there a placard or sign or anything with any details or even an inscription that says Dogecoin at all?

This is not GME folks. People expecting doge to hit anywhere near $10 or even $5 this year are wayyyy too naive. Realistically we're looking at doge trading somewhere between $1 - $3 by year end..and thats IF everything goes well without huge cashouts from those invested@ <0.001

$3 - $5 in 2022 and maybe MAYBE $6-$9 by 2023 year end.

The only way dogecoin becomes adopted as the actual coin of the internet is if we get as many establishments and businesses on board with accepting dogecoin for payment/transaction processes.

All memes aside this is definitely a long term hold investment and if you're one of those people pumping thousands of life savings into a meme coin expecting to get rich overnight..prepare to be very disappointed.

edit: timeline is pure speculation obviously. dogecoins will appreciate, just not the rate this subs hyping it up to be

Wow. Just meanie meanies. Mean mean mean. This was 8 years ago. Soured me a bunch on crypto in general. 

Then I found doge. Nice folks answered my questions, walked me through getting a wallet, pointed my in the right directions. And the memes were hilarious. 

Then we started doing things as a group.  It was fun. *I got my shirt*. I helped build some wells, donated some socks. Good things. That made me feel good.

So whatever I make with Doge will stay with Doge until I have a good reason to move it.
$1 is not a target sale price, just the new floor target, one day we will see $1 the same way as we see 10c today as we aim for $10 and beyond.
If we hit 1$ for sure there will be a huge sell and dip , but think once we reach that point there will no return , no joke coin anymore, no pump coin anymore , at that point we will be established in a better position than anyone. Once we are at that point, in the moment we all realize that, hold after 1$ will be the unique option from logic , as  hold btc is . Even at that point , the skepticals will take this as the serious option is, and will get on board.

Hahahah I play a little game.  Am I up or down $500?  I check every 2 hours.  Its a like making a bet, good times.  Diamond hands. To the moon.
TO ALL NEWCOMERS:   


This is not GME yall. People expecting doge to hit anywhere near $10 or even $5 this year are wayyyy too naive. Realistically we're looking at doge trading somewhere between $1 - $3 by year end..and thats IF everything goes well without huge cashouts from those invested@ <0.001

$3 - $5 in 2022 and maybe $6-$9 by 2023 year end.

The only way dogecoin becomes adopted as the actual coin of the internet is if we get as many establishments and businesses on board with accepting dogecoin for payment/transaction processes. Doge being accepted in exchange for goods and services is the only thing that will give the currency any staying power. Otherwise it'll just crash once the whales stop the hype train.

All memes aside this is definitely a long term hold investment and if you're one of those people pumping thousands of life savings into a meme coin expecting to get rich overnight..prepare to be very disappointed."

If the lot of us can do this every week it can stop the massive pumps that people just try to sell out for and creates a stable increase that helps encourage more people to invest in.

For Doge to really take off and make the current pump look like a small jump, we still need 2 important pieces of tech that currently do not exist:

- A metamask-like doge wallet as a browser add-on
- A Doge payment gateway

We have doge payment gateway, but not the right ones. You still need to copy their address, go to your wallet, paste the address, past the exact amount they give you, send & hope for the best.

What we need is a payment gateway where people click ""Submit cart"" and the browser wallet add-on pops up, show the details of the transaction and ask Approve/Reject. The payment gateway would provide a modern SDK to the merchants, with webhooks & callbacks for easy & fast integration. No copy-paste involved. Click, confirm, done.

Did I miss those tech in my research?

Even the BSC chain has them, but Doge doesn't it seems.

I'm starting work on those 2 pieces, but with my full-time engineering job + a baby, it's gonna take me months to get there, especially with 2 parallel projects. 

Hopefully somebody beats me to it so the merchant adoption can increase dramatically.


Edit: I looked into it and this will require to run a Dogecoin node & manage wallets' private keys. This means a high level of security & recurring server costs. I'm starting prototyping, but sadly this will not be an open-source project. The existing APIs are too expensive to scale (block.io, ...)
What scares me is the fact that doge isn't scarce. While we are here freaking out watching candles there must be people mining thousands of dogecoins everyday nonstop which will increase supply amount."

Why F? It’s up from a day or two ago. People are never happy lol.
Guys,  doge coin is not going to go to the moon if you're constantly holding and not spending. Holding some for Long term is fine, but you should also have a crypto wallet that allows you to spend the coin for regular  purchases. This is not going to happen overnight to make it to a dollar. There are too many people just holding the currency like its the last of the coins in earth. The more we spend on transactions the more the coin is accepted and desired to push it to a stronger value. I believe the bitcoin price craze has put damaging effects on doge coin already. Nobodt wants to miss out on the chance of becoming a millionaire, bit at the same time we can't think it's going to become anything without trading it for goods. 
  
     I love this currency as much as the next person, but until we start spending it and trading it as much as your homeland currency then we will be at a 5 to 7 cent stalemate for a while.the community does an excellent job with promoting the coin, i just see the lack of enthusiasm in spending it. If everyone woukd ban together and start bombarding amazon to accept the coin 🪙 until they do , that would be a massive step in the right direction. People will follow suit to purchase the coin and even older people will follow suit, but until more major retail giants takes the coin, all we are doing is just making meme, hoarding the coin like pirate's and slowing progress. 

    Anyways I'm not here to point fingers, just trying to explain what I see is going on. Maybe some can starting now start posting your purchases with doge coin on this sub to get others excited about thier hard work in PR with doge. I dont esnt this post to seem negative at all and I am very excited and proud to be apart of such a great community and hope that this does reach a dollar or 10, but let's focus are energy on making that a true reality with all of us. Just remember, is you that makes doge coin not Elon musk or mark Cuban or the coin itself. Good people make great things a possibility."

650	DOGE market cap is now equal to Bitcoin’s two years ago🚀🚀	1620463201.0	8822	"I'm mainly here for the memes and because I think Bitcoin is stupid. But for those wondering about Doge inflation, have a peek at the market caps of Fiat currencies (measured in BTC and total supply): https://fiatmarketcap.com/

If Crypto is actually going to become a thing, the endless supply of Doge is actually something that could establish it as a stable currency (something that seems far more difficult for Bitcoin) thus making it a legitimately better currency.

Also, you cannot just throw endless data power on Doge to create infinite amounts. You can only make an amount per day which someone else did the math on yesterday, to show makes up less inflation than pre-covid US Dollar (post covid us dollar inflation would of course, be considerably worse than max Doge inflation).

A currency is a collective belief, only two currencies have the PR pull at the moment to be used as true global currencies, Bitcoin and Doge and while Doge was made as a joke, the technology it was made on wasn't a joke and just might be legitimately better than Bitcoin's.

Doge will not likely ever reach 1.000.000 USD per coin. Probably not even 500.000 USD per coin. But it can certainly hit 10.000 USD per coin and still be considered at a sensible market cap if one considers it a true currency.

What it needs for this is mainstream publicity and ease of use as payment...and I'm seeing people buy coffee with Doge without any hassles these days so when you guys talk about holding past 1 dollar or 10 dollars I honestly just laugh.

You guys think that with the FOMO and Stimulus checks existent in the u.s market this train is going to stop at 1 or 10 dollars?

Once the U.S mainstream realizes they might have found a ""new"" bitcoin at 1~ dollar value the frenzy is going to be shocking. It'll be a bumpy ride getting there, for sure. If you're struggling financially, by all means take some profit on the way up. But do not sell your full stake. You will regret it.
im actually impressed
Doesnt this scare anyone? I understand groupthink but ud think smart money will sell off around $1ish right? How likely will the coin go back to 5 cents a piece?"

Hold! When you’re in your 20s or 30s you’ll be happy you did, and it’ll come faster than you think.  Set yourself up for success!! 

Also start investing in other long term investments. You can get a great return by the time you’re out of school if you start now.

Edit: When/if Doge really takes off, there’s also no shame in selling enough to cover living expenses/debts/dreams. But don’t sell it all and buy back in later!

I use Coinbase to take those quizzes to get free coins, convert to Bitcoin, then transfer it to Kraken and buy Dogecoin there. I've gotten about $40 in free Dogecoin doing that when it was worth around 25¢.
As a long time Doge enthusiast I’m actually offended that they never listed our coin. I gave up on them. Who needs Coinbase? Nobody that’s who!

Kraken is actually pretty good."

Wish this was true but sadly when people have that much in they become paper hands and will come back in when we all are holding we need a person like @deepfuckvalue  to be willing to lose and hold with us
I am an Indian retard who could only afford 200 coins at the moment, gonna be buying more. In the meantime, I'm advertising it by changing my profile and bio to ""Doge to the moon 🐶🌙🚀💎🙌"" Since this is a global currency, we're all in this together."

Hold to Mars for me!
I've only bought more, sold none.
For sure. I think this is one of those things you hodl for the long run! I think alot of people who sold or bought into the hype and didn't see it shoot up don't understand that.

https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/l83oq8/here_is_the_plan_guys/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

LISTEN EVERYBODY: There’s a lot of people on here who have no idea what the hell they are talking about. DO NOT SELL. You will regret it later. The apps are crashing because hundreds of thousands of people are trying to buy. Robinhood isn’t allowing instant transfers because they can’t afford to loan everybody money while the bank processes your deposit. This common practice. It’s always been like this for years. Anybody who tells you different is dumb money and has no idea what they’re saying. You can buy doge once your money clears. THE PRICE IS GOING TO SKY ROCKET. SCREW THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀➡️🪐

We are the pioneers. WE (400,000 who are in this thread) DECIDE THE PRICE.

We have a chance for generational wealth. Don’t be stupid.

THIS IS FOR THE HOLDERS: I have a plan. Hear me out. If you agree; upvote

Let’s all collectively agree to set the floor at .05. The majority of people here should have purchased their dogecoin below this price.

This means that if we buy anytime it starts to dip under .05 it will raise back to at least that threshold. it doesn’t have to be much 5 dollars by 400,000 people is monumental.

Next step. When it reaches $1 sell EXACTLY 10% of your coin. NOT all. This way we can get some net profit no matter what happens. So if In the off chance it does completely crash you already made profit. Since the 10% will cover your initial investment and some change.

After that the remaining 90% just HOLD YOUR ROCKET 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TO THE STARS

127 Billion Doge in circulation - 600,000 of us

I’m new so please don’t fault me for this but I have been investing in crypto and stocks for years. Thankful for all of you!

Just did some quick research. There is 127 billion dogecoins in circulation. With 5 billion being created every year.

So it is infinite but also finite in time. Doing some quick math, if our 600,000 users own 200,000 dogecoins each, at let’s say (@ 0.029, which would cost $5,800) we would essentially own the entire market of dogecoins.

Note, 113 billion coins have already been mined. So who knows how many some people are holding. But this tells me that we have a very very good chance of this going to the moon. I was very skeptical at first but if we all keep buying and holding there is no way this does not go to the moon. 

Holding 329,000 doge and I’m buying every dip.  I bought in at .049 and have bought myself down to .031. Holdin like a US Open Trophy!"

I sold $20k worth and paid off all my debnts. I still have 180k DOGE. Hodling most of it for $1. 

50k of my doge is on the Kraken exchange. I just do margin trading. It's paying off well so far. Made $2k in one trade last week."

It's hard when you immediately lost half the value of your investment post-purchase.
If you need to take profit for bills an emergency etc then DO IT. Constantly spamming “hodl” is toxic, especially for DOGE. This is a currency not a store of value.
For real! .69 hodlers stay strong… No Doge left behind 🚀"

It was a great day for shopping! Busted out the emergency bank (who needs food?!), and was able to pick up a few more. Being honest, I bought other coins too, but did get 125k more Doge to add to the collection!

£ is what we need"
888	I had to do it	1612321747.0	7034	"Now this is good meme, you're the goodest doge.
Can I get EVERYONE'S commitment that we will not sell til at LEAST $1.00

LET'S all make money & make DOGECOIN forever.

Absolutely do not sell all of it at $1.00 if we all sell all the dogecoins at a dollar it just goes back down to .01 again.

Here's a good plan:

At $1.00 sell 10% of your dogecoin. You made mad profit off your initial investment and you still have thousands of dogecoins that can appreciate to greater value. Remember the bigger picture is to the moon. We don't get to the moon if we sell at a penny profit.

So, do this with me my friends. Sell only 10% of your dogecoins after we hit $1.00 And keep HOLDING the other 90% you purchased.

I don't think that track is proper for super cars. Go-Karts, maybe.

Plus the karts would be more fun.
It’s in Moneymore, Northern Ireland (about half an hour from where I live)

939	With today's push passed $0.40, my profits from doge have finally surpassed $400. I know it's not much compared to a lot of people here, but it's a lot for a poor college student like me. I just want to thank this community for the wild ride this far and the awesome ride to the moon still ahead.	1620101110.0	6675	"Your post made me realize something about this community. There are some people that show off their million in doge, others that didn't get much, or lost money, some that have had significant but not life changing extra money, also people who sold to get a better life. And I only rarely see people that are jealous, mean, and bad with each others. People just wish each others for the best, just hoping doge will skyrocket and everyone will win. That's just a shift of paradigm against a society that wants us to compete all against each others, and that freacking refreshing.

Congrats to you, and have fun with this ride !
This is the way
Hey. We’re all in this together. The deep pockets and the not so deep pockets. I’m sitting around the same as you but haven’t hit $400 yet. And I’m 42 with a wife and kids. 

Long story short, due to job loss, the pandemic, and the need to care for my mother in law as she died of cancer I had to cash out everything. 401k, an annuity, and a modest investment portfolio. I been out of full time work for a year and a half. Part time jobs aren’t paying the bills. Cashing out, even with the penalties was my only option. 

But I just wanted to get in on this. Took an extra 5 bucks and bought what I could when it was at a penny. Have made a few more small purchases when I have extra cash since then. And will keep going until we see it all the way!!!

Way to go! Hold baby hold!"

-1 year returns were 3,420%.....

LISTEN EVERYBODY: There’s a lot of people on here who have no idea what the hell they are talking about. DO NOT SELL. You will regret it later. The apps are crashing because hundreds of thousands of people are trying to buy. Robinhood isn’t allowing instant transfers because they can’t afford to loan everybody money while the bank processes your deposit. This common practice. It’s always been like this for years. Anybody who tells you different is dumb money and has no idea what they’re saying. You can buy doge once your money clears. THE PRICE IS GOING TO SKY ROCKET. SCREW THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀➡️🪐

We are the pioneers. WE (400,000 who are in this thread) DECIDE THE PRICE.

We have a chance for generational wealth. Don’t be stupid.

THIS IS FOR THE HOLDERS: I have a plan. Hear me out. If you agree; upvote

Let’s all collectively agree to set the floor at .05. The majority of people here should have purchased their dogecoin below this price.

This means that if we buy anytime it starts to dip under .05 it will raise back to at least that threshold. it doesn’t have to be much 5 dollars by 400,000 people is monumental.

Next step. When it reaches $1 sell EXACTLY 10% of your coin. NOT all. This way we can get some net profit no matter what happens. So if In the off chance it does completely crash you already made profit. Since the 10% will cover your initial investment and some change.

After that the remaining 90% just HOLD YOUR ROCKET 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TO THE STARS

Not scared. Invested money I am willing to lose, will survive if doge hits. 002 again.
Almost all other cryptos had the same thing happen, likely a coordinated foreign effort to trigger stop-losses and pick up across the boards dirt cheap to sell again when it recuperates. Nearly every one was graphically identical: Steep decline followed by sudden drop(stop-losses), slight pickup before a slight drop, getting any last panic sellers to bail, and has now begun the path to correction, it won’t automatically shoot back up to record prices ffs. It’s meant to be a currency, and that’s one way to solidify doges future, get it to be an accepted global currency, but that can’t happen if everyone just hodls or sells. Make it into a currency, this recent spike will be minuscule. It’s already following pattens exhibited by Bitcoin back in 2013-2014 before it took off."

huh so if i buy 100 doge coins right now i'll get 50% off tesla when doge coin is above 1$ ?!!! omggg why didn't i think this one before 🤯"
973	I caught the moment :,)	1622469125.0	6472	"I looked at this 15 times before I realised what’s going on.
Me toooo!!! I kept reloading every second lmao
Does this mean we all get 2,000,000 doge for witnessing this?"
974	This is very true! I actually bought it as a joke and now I have over 20k invested.... 💎🤲	1617976292.0	6466	"I initially dismissed Doge. Then I realized the power of memes and pop culture. Now I say ""much wow"" a little too often. 😂
The world has changed.  Millennials are taking over.  Millennials love memes.  Millennials love jokes.  Millennials REALLY LOVE irony.  It has value because we say it has value.   It will continue to have value as long as we continue to value it.
Back in 2013, I bought some ""serious"" coins (BTC, LTC), and wanted to get the ""dumbest, most ridiculous coin"", so I bought a few hundred thousand dogecoins. Wasn't a bad strategy."
975	Seeing a lot of this lately	1613603116.0	6460	"I just want doge coin so when I die, and my kids see their inheritance they will go wtf is doge coin? And my wife will say your father was an idiot
Don’t forget “tells his whole family to get in right before it hits .08”
The Reddit has become insufferable in the last few weeks. I liked it more when it was just Shibe Memes and 1 Doge = 1 Doge"
976	This absolute mic drop of a moment went unnoticed by regulars but it was a fkn rallying call for the #Dogecoinarmy !!!	1620660389.0	6455	"That was pretty funny. 


And it's a conversation I have all the time about how the dollar is a real currency and doge is not tangible and a Ponzi scheme, etc. People think because they have a piece of paper in their hand that it means something.
I feel like this joke went over most peoples heads
That whole skit was misinterpreted IMO. I didnt hear a negative thing about doge coin throughout it including calling it a hustle...the entire stock market and crypto market is a hustle."
977	DOGE community be like...	1617667494.0	6449	"I meen if I was one of the people who bought them when they were 0.00083 each. I for sure would be selling at 6 if it meant millions.
I’m hangin out till $10, idk why ppl keep looking for instant gratification. I HODL and add a little more every week and swing by here to check on my fellow shibes. 

I, personally, don’t want to be that person that’s kicking themselves when the rocket takes off bc I sold my ticket. So I put some spare change in, and I forget about it till the following week, do it again. I don’t expect immediate returns, you shouldn’t either.

Sit back, hang out, enjoy the community.

My spacesuit will be green I think.
i wont even sell at 1$"
978	You guys are coming back for me, right?	1625876758.0	6444	"Doge is busy with side quests, once it gets back on the main quest line, it’s gonna be OP
A test of your patience and 💎🙌!

Most definitely.  It may take a while but, no man gets left behind.

979	Went in at .003 - Just cashed out some profits, drove 1,600 miles and gave this goodest boy a new home. He’s 4y old and full of love. Do Only Good Everyday	1629223895.0	6448	"Ah that second pic pulled on my heart strings. Pup experiencing new things 🥲
The question is does the pup have a white tip on the tail....  :-)
This is the way"
980	The Dogefather with another tweet	1620722626.0	6438	"Wow such puritanical! What’s wrong with calling it a hustle? Bunch of betas if you ask me.
i have a feeling he is somehow trying to make up for this hustle thing gone wrong... intention was different and as i see it, they meant to use the positive meaning of ""hustle"" while most of the audience took the negative meaning out of it.... this will be corrected by time and memes imo. everybody loves to hustle a bit,no?
It is the people’s hustle to break free from the central banks grip on us. They control the media and keep the people enslaved in debt."
981	I spent $5,000 on Dogecoin billboards across the country 😂 MAKE THIS VIRAL!!!	1613149328.0	6430	"You spend your own money for all the holders. Appreciate the effort but the strength is too little. Open up for donation and we do it together.

I saw this on a few articles and thought it was funny. They were calling him the Great Value version of Captain America!"
985	❤️🔥	1624117017.0	6416	"Honestly, if I make it big off of Doge, I'm going to all my local animal shelters, veterinarians, and animal hospitals in my area and paying bills and donating to adoption centers. I want to do this.
We need to rally around this! The message behind D.O.G.E. is inspirational. Plus its super marketable. i know I am personally looking for Doge shirts, and if I can't find any, I'm going to make one lol
Donated 10k worth of DOGE when it was \~.50 to the local food bank.  Help the people that need help."

989	🚨🚨It’s the whales DONT PANIC 🚨🚨	1620532618.0	6389	"Hold position anti doge mines are all over . Don’t sell
This! Whales dumping is GOOD, it lets more ppl get in to diversify instead of one big whale
POINT IS, DON'T GIVE AWAY YOUR MONEY.  IF YOU DON'T SELL DURING PANIC, it WILL BOUNCE.  Trying to get off an 80 mph roller coaster in the middle of a ride will get you killed.  Strap in and enjoy the ride down and back up!!!! 🎢"

991	Me watching Dogecoin value after buying in at .50	1623889142.0	6385	"Imagine buying at .07, only to sell at .05, then buying back in at .50 and seeing the price now. Lesson learned: JUST Fing HODL.
Better than buying at .7 followed by having to live in a van down by the river.
This is a perfect example of why I will always tell the following story: 

A number of years back, nearly 10 years, a person offered me a few hundred Bitcoin in exchange for some Magic the Gathering cards I had. I declined and ended up selling them for a good deal of cash, or so I thought. I’d be a multi-millionaire if I wasn’t so short ~~sided~~ sighted.

Don’t kick yourself in the nards for making an investment, you have no idea where it’ll go one way or the other. HODL!  
  
:edit: Hilariously lame typo corrected."
992	Just Hodl 🙌💎🙌	1621831493.0	6366	"I can’t WAIT til that day.  It’s gonna be just like the Scarface moment in Half Baked…except with a LOT more people.
The media 2 months ago:  BTC and Crypto are industry changing!

The media the past 2 days: is the bubble about to burst, crypto is useless, what a dumb thing
I love you doge and doge community! Cheers to all who holded and didn't sell any doge. 
1 doge = 1 doge.

Law of diminishing returns.  Every little hint or mention or nod to DOGEcoin he puts out, I suspect will have less and less impact.
He is still with us!"
997	😂😂🐶🚀🚀	1617569372.0	6320	"Legitimate question: Is there a way the government can track your Bitcoin/dogecoin? Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin secrecy and safety of your money?
That is a problem I’ll be happy to deal with when Doge is at $1

998	I promised my son if we made it to .50 on Doge, that we would adopt a puppy and pay for all her first year puppy needs with the doge we cashed out . Meet Natasha ! Thanks Dogecoin 😙	1620255193.0	6318	"Doge dog... let's all adopt.. no dog left behind.. doge to the moon
